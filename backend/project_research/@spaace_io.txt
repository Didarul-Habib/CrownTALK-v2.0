SPAACE.IO — DEEP DIVE RESEARCH (Well-organized, “every angle”)
Generated: 2026-01-11

IMPORTANT NOTES / LIMITATIONS
- Some parts of spaace.io (especially app pages) are heavily JavaScript-rendered; I relied on Spaace’s Litepaper (GitBook), Spaace Blog, and Spaace Support Hub for verifiable details.
- I could not directly read content from X (Twitter) in this environment. Social metrics in this report are therefore taken from Spaace’s own litepaper sections (where present), and not from the X profile timeline itself.
- Some legal documents linked from vision.spaace.io were hosted on DocSend and returned “403 Forbidden” from the research tool, so they could not be reviewed directly.

1) QUICK SNAPSHOT
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Project name: Spaace (spaace.io)
Category: NFT marketplace + gamification layer (Battle Pass) + planned creator tools
Primary chain focus today: Ethereum (ETH); roadmap mentions expansion to other EVMs + some non‑EVMs (Solana, Ordinals)

Core claim / positioning:
- “The most rewarding NFT marketplace” with “100% revenue sharing” (redistributing marketplace fee revenue to token stakers in ETH).
- Gamifies NFT trading and engagement via a Battle Pass (XP, ranks, quests, leaderboards, chapter rewards).

Key product surfaces:
- Marketplace (trading)
- Battle Pass (gamification)
- Support hub (help center)
- Blog (platform updates + educational content)
- Litepaper (vision, mechanics, token utility, incentives)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) WHAT SPAACE IS BUILDING (ELEVATOR PITCH)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Spaace aims to be an “all‑in‑one NFT hub” where:
- users trade NFTs in a gamified environment (Battle Pass),
- the community earns rewards (XP, chests, seasonal airdrops, referrals),
- and (planned) anyone can create NFT collections quickly using creator tooling.

The system’s “hook” is the Battle Pass: actions on the marketplace (listings, offers, volume, royalties, referrals, etc.) generate XP and progression, which then influences rewards including seasonal $SPAACE airdrops and in‑platform perks.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) PRODUCT & USER EXPERIENCE (HOW IT WORKS)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3.1 Marketplace basics
- Spaace is described as a community-driven NFT marketplace on Ethereum.
- Fee model:
  - Support Hub states Spaace charges a 0.75% trading fee on sales and only the seller pays it.
  - A November platform update explains the platform ran “several months at 0% fees” and then introduced the 0.75% fee to enable sustainable revenue sharing and operations.
  - Note: Spaace’s litepaper “USPs” page contains a comparative table listing 0.5% trading fees—this appears to be older/outdated relative to the Support Hub and later platform update.

Gas fees:
- Spaace does not receive gas fees; gas is paid to Ethereum validators for on-chain transactions. Some actions (after approvals) can be “gas-free” in the sense of not requiring a new gas payment (e.g., listing after approving a collection).

3.2 Battle Pass (Gamification engine)
Battle Pass overview:
- Converts NFT traders/collectors into “players” competing for XP and leaderboard positions.
- Designed with gamification consultants (Yu‑kai Chou / Octalysis Group) per Spaace litepaper.

Seasons & Chapters:
- Spaace runs “Seasons” composed of “Chapters”.
- Chapters bring new quests, features, and chapter rewards (example: “Mystery Chests”).
- End-of-season: a $SPAACE token airdrop is conducted, where leaderboard ranking influences allocation.

Ranks:
- Users start at Bronze 5 and can progress through 25 ranks up to Diamond 1.

Quests (XP sources):
Litepaper lists 4 major quest types:
- Prime Quests (highest XP):
  - Prime Listings: list Prime-Collection NFTs to earn hourly XP
  - Prime Bidding: bid on Prime-Collection NFTs to earn hourly XP
  - Prime Referral: invite friends and earn 10% of their XP
- Daily Quests (reset every 24 hours)
- Genesis Quests (intro quests, once per season)
- Progressive Quests (completed gradually over time)

Prime Collections:
- Special set of collections that earn more XP for listing/trading/bidding.
- Prime Collections appear directly on the marketplace.

Leaderboard & boosts:
- Global leaderboard ranks users.
- Higher ranks can earn daily XP boosts and larger seasonal airdrop allocations.

Spaace Score (loyalty metric):
- Litepaper + Support Hub describe a “Spaace Score” measuring loyalty via listings.
- It increases when users list owned NFTs on Spaace and avoid listing on other marketplaces.
- Support Hub notes higher Spaace Scores increase odds of receiving rare “Quantum Chests” in Chapter 2 rewards, which can increase the $SPAACE airdrop at TGE.

Anti-abuse / fairness changes:
- A Chapter 2 update states that some users tried to farm XP with repeated low-value trades; Chapter 2 changes “reward actual trading volume, not just transaction count,” including progressive volume quests.

3.3 Newer gameplay layers (late 2025 updates)
- Spaace Pro Mode (Beta): a more advanced trading layout aimed at power users.
- Dark Mode introduced.
- “Tournaments” (limited-time events) reward top traders with large XP bonuses based on BUY volume and leaderboard ranks. (Example: first tournament distributes >10,000,000 XP across the top 100 traders; top tier requires 100 ETH BUY volume.)

Activity gating (anti-sybil + reward integrity):
- December update describes “Activity Gating”: inactive users only see Genesis quests; a $20 transaction unlocks the full Battle Pass.

3.4 Security & user protection
- Support Hub notes Spaace is a non-custodial marketplace; scams can exist because anyone can deploy contracts.
- December update: unverified collections no longer displayed after scam rise; warnings for non-verified collections; backend security upgrades and “cheater detection” reinforced.
- Support Hub provides user-facing due diligence guidance (verification badges, Prime status, supply/holders, suspiciously low prices, etc.) and notes Spaace cannot reverse on-chain transactions or refund scam purchases.

3.5 Customer support (scaling operations)
- December update: live chat support system added to website.
- Help Center launched (support.spaace.io) plus “Astro” AI support agent (24/7 for common questions).

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) REWARDS, INCENTIVES & ECONOMIC DESIGN
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

4.1 “Giving back” (reward philosophy)
- Spaace positions rewards as a core retention/incentive engine, intended to:
  - give back to community,
  - increase retention,
  - boost NFT collection activity,
  - support creators.
- Rewards system is described as using “proprietary algorithms and AI frameworks” to distribute rewards sustainably.

4.2 Reward types (from litepaper USPs)
Spaace describes multiple reward categories, including:
- Cashback rewards (daily $SPAACE rewards proportional to trading volume)
- Staking for 100% revenue sharing (fees redistributed to stakers as ETH + additional $SPAACE)
- Airdrops (seasonal airdrops based on Battle Pass progression/leaderboard)
- Referral program (sponsors earn a percentage of referred users’ rewards + fee revenue)
- Ambassador / KOL program (higher referral commissions)
- Liquidity provider rewards (provide ETH<>$SPAACE liquidity on DEXs for daily rewards)

4.3 Airdrops (eligibility & optimization)
Litepaper outlines:
- Airdrops occur at end of every season.
- Allocation based on XP (relative to other players) and final leaderboard rank.
- Ways to maximize XP for airdrops: list top NFTs near floor, place offers, invite friends, claim chapter rewards, participate in Discord.
- Eligibility may include: Battle Pass XP, past Spaace Arena XP, active Discord membership; plus future categories like “Gold” and “Partnerships”.

4.4 Referral program details (litepaper)
Two layers described:
- Standard Program:
  - Up to 30% of referred users’ trading fees (in ETH)
  - 10% of referred users’ XP
  - Up to 50% of referred users’ cashback + staking rewards in $SPAACE
- Ambassador Program (for influencers/KOLs):
  - Commissions 20% to 50% of referred users’ ETH trading fees (vs 10% to 30% standard)
  - Commission increases tied to Battle Pass rank

4.5 Revenue sharing model (high-level)
- Spaace’s long-term narrative: earn marketplace revenue back as a community.
- Implementation depends on token staking (details depend on $SPAACE launch / TGE and staking contracts).

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5) TOKEN: $SPAACE (ERC20) — WHAT’S PUBLISHED
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Token type & chain:
- Spaace litepaper describes $SPAACE as an ERC20 token on Ethereum.

Stated utilities (litepaper token page):
- Staking for daily APY in $SPAACE
- Staking for ETH (100% revenue sharing of marketplace fees in ETH)
- Referral/Affiliation benefits for holders/stakers
- Staking for XP rewards (more tokens + longer stake → more XP)
- “Token Score” / “Token Score improves rewards” (buying/holding increases user score)
- Liquidity farming (provide $SPAACE and ETH liquidity)

Buyback concept:
- Litepaper says a portion of marketplace fees (in ETH) may be used for daily buybacks:
  - Manual buybacks by team/market makers using fee revenue
  - Automatic swaps: “Prime Staking” swaps ETH into $SPAACE multiple times/day, creating continuous buy pressure

Token supply / allocation / contract address:
- I did NOT find a publicly indexed section in accessible sources that provides total supply, vesting schedules, allocation breakdown, or official contract address.
- Recommendation: verify token contract only via official Spaace channels at token launch (TGE) and beware of lookalike tokens.

Disclaimer language (important):
- Litepaper disclaimer states the litepaper is informational, not a solicitation, and that information is subject to change.
- It names “SDF Limited” as the token issuer and emphasizes investment risks and need for independent due diligence.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6) ECOSYSTEM COMPONENTS (WHAT EXISTS / WHAT’S PLANNED)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.1 Spaace Arena (ended)
- Litepaper: “Spaace Arena has officially ended.”
- Arena XP is planned to be converted into exclusive rewards; Arena users get a dedicated airdrop allocation at TGE.
- Litepaper lists historical metrics (Arena users, posts, XP collected, etc.)—treat these as project-claimed metrics.

6.2 “Flip Launchpad” (soon)
- Listed as “soon” in litepaper navigation (no detailed accessible content in current retrieval).

6.3 Creator Program (soon)
- Litepaper indicates a “Creator Program (soon).”
- USPs mention an NFT creation tool that would allow anyone to create collections “without the need for an artist, developers and a marketing budget” (positioned as a “PumpFun + Midjourney combined” concept).

6.4 Expansion roadmap
- Litepaper and Support Hub say launch on ETH first, then diversify into other EVMs; and plans to integrate non‑EVMs like Solana and Ordinals.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7) BUSINESS MODEL & GO-TO-MARKET
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Revenue model:
- Marketplace fee on sales (currently documented as 0.75%).
- Future token-driven flywheel:
  - Collect fees → (share to stakers / buybacks / incentives) → attract traders → more fees.
- Referral program tied to fee revenue is marketed as a differentiator.

Marketing/community:
- Messaging focuses heavily on a community movement (“#NFTARMY”) and incentives for early adopters.
- Battle Pass seasons/chapters create recurring engagement loops (quests → XP → leaderboard → airdrops).

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8) FUNDING, OWNERSHIP, TEAM
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Funding (project-claimed):
- Litepaper claims Spaace “raised over $6M” during a bear market.
- It says 400+ individual investors from 50+ countries participated; and a significant portion came via community groups.
- It also claims founders allocated “several millions” of personal funds.

Team:
- Public documentation in the sources reviewed does not list individual team member names.
- Messaging frames the team as “builders, collectors, and full-time explorers of the NFT frontier.”

Entity:
- Litepaper disclaimer references “SDF Limited” as token issuer.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9) COMPETITIVE POSITIONING
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Spaace explicitly compares itself vs OpenSea, Blur, Magic Eden, etc. (litepaper USPs table). Claimed differentiators:
- Gamification (Battle Pass)
- 100% revenue sharing (via staking)
- Cashback, staking, referral rewards
- Creator tool / launchpad (planned)
- Aggregation (claimed)

Note:
- Some values in comparative table (e.g., “Trading Fees 0.5%”) appear inconsistent with later support/blog updates that specify 0.75%. Treat the table as potentially outdated.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
10) RISKS, RED FLAGS & DUE DILIGENCE CHECKLIST
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A) Token-launch risk:
- Token is described as “soon” (and some token pages show “Last updated 1 year ago”).
- Verify launch status, contract address, audits, and token distribution only via official channels at TGE.

B) Incentive sustainability:
- High incentives (cashback, airdrops, revenue sharing) require sustained fee revenue and careful emissions control.
- Spaace states they use algorithms/AI for emissions; however, the exact parameters are not public in sources reviewed.

C) Marketplace integrity:
- Scam collections are a known ecosystem risk; Spaace introduced gating, verification filtering, and warnings. Still, non-custodial design means users must DYOR.

D) Metrics & claims:
- Some traction metrics and “rank” claims appear in Spaace’s own materials. Treat as self-reported unless independently verified.

Practical checklist:
1) Confirm the official $SPAACE contract address (when announced) from multiple official Spaace channels (website + litepaper + Discord announcements).
2) Review staking contract audits (if any), and on-chain permissions/upgradeability.
3) Validate fee structure & revenue-sharing mechanics (how fees are distributed, cadence, eligibility, and exclusions).
4) Understand XP/quest anti-abuse rules (gating, minimum transaction, volume calculations).
5) For creators: confirm whether the “collection creator tool” is live, and what standards (ERC-721/1155, royalties, verification) apply.
6) For traders: check which collections are “Prime” and the implications for XP/rewards.
