SIXR Cricket (sixrcricket.com) — Deep Dive (Web3 Cricket / SportsFi)

Prepared: 2026-01-11 (Asia/Dhaka)

======================================================================
0) Quick Snapshot
======================================================================
Project: SIXR Cricket
Tagline/positioning: “The home of cricket fans – play, compete, and connect with legends, all inside Telegram.”
Core idea: A cricket game + fan ecosystem that blends gameplay, challenges, collectibles (NFTs), and rewards.
Claimed chain focus: TON (The Open Network), with mentions of “multi-chain access” in community surfaces.

Key official / primary links (as provided & discovered):
- Website: https://sixrcricket.com/
- X (Twitter): https://x.com/SIXR_cricket  (linked from multiple official pages)
- Telegram channel: https://t.me/sixrcricket
- Discord: (linked from Linktree)
- Token site: https://www.sixrtoken.com/  (content is highly script-driven)
- Tokenomics dashboard domain: https://sixr-cricket.com/  (script-driven; limited text extraction)

======================================================================
1) What SIXR Cricket Says It Is
======================================================================
From the website, SIXR frames itself as a reimagined cricket experience with:
- Multiple play modes: Quick Play, PvP, Tournaments, and a dedicated “SIXR Mode”
- “Fan battles” and competition for leaderboard/bragging rights
- In-game “Gems” earned via skill-based gameplay/participation
- Gear progression: bats, boosts, cosmetics
- “True digital ownership” via NFT cricket bats and other in-game assets
- Secondary-market trading “using your TON wallet”
- A “decentralized lending and borrowing” concept using “gems as collateral for cash”
- A “no downloads, no setup” message: “all inside Telegram”

======================================================================
2) Product & UX — How It Likely Works (Based on Public Signals)
======================================================================
2.1 Telegram-native distribution
- Linktree and Telegram both describe SIXR as a Web3 cricket ecosystem on TON and position it as accessible inside Telegram.
- This implies a Telegram bot / mini-app flow (common for TON ecosystem): users connect a TON wallet, complete quests, and interact via Telegram UI.

2.2 “First Innings” campaign (tasks + referrals)
- There is a dedicated “First Innings” experience (firstinnings.sixrcricket.com) that describes earning rewards by completing tasks, referring friends, and climbing a leaderboard.
- This looks like a pre-launch growth funnel: quests + referrals + points/rewards.

2.3 Gameplay loop (as described on the site)
- Match types: Quick, PvP, tournaments, and the “SIXR Mode”.
- Progression: earn Gems → unlock upgrades/cosmetics/bats → compete → earn more.
- “Battle against the stars” language suggests licensed/partnered “icon” content, or at minimum star-themed avatars and themed challenges.

======================================================================
3) Collectibles / NFTs
======================================================================
3.1 Chris Gayle partnership (press release)
A press release (ACCESS Newswire, Sep 17, 2025) states:
- Chris Gayle joined as an “Icon Player”
- SIXR will roll out time-boxed Chris Gayle digital collectibles, sticker packs, and community challenges
- Prizes include “exclusive Chris Gayle NFTs”
- CEO quoted: “Ahad Bhai, CEO of SIXR Cricket”
This is one of the clearest sources naming an executive and describing near-term drops.

3.2 TON collectibles on Getgems
A Getgems collection listing (“The Legends Collection by SIXR Cricket”) describes:
- 666-supply digital collectible launching on TON
- Featuring cricket icons: Chris Gayle, Shahid Afridi, and Eoin Morgan
Note: The collection page itself is heavily script-driven in the crawler, but the listing snippet contains the key descriptors.

======================================================================
4) Token ($SIXR) — Utility, Supply, and On-chain Traces
======================================================================
4.1 Claimed utility (from token site snippet)
The SIXR token site states that “$SIXR fuels everything inside the SIXR world — from in-game upgrades to fan rewards and exclusive player experiences.”
(Full token-site content is not easily extractable via crawler due to heavy scripting; treat as partial.)

4.2 Tokenomics dashboard (limited extraction)
A separate tokenomics dashboard domain (sixr-cricket.com) includes text indicating:
- “Tokeneconomy v 1.2” dated “August 1st 2025”
- Total supply: 1,000,000,000 $SIXR
However, the full allocation breakdown/graphs are not extractable via the crawler (site appears JS-rendered). Treat this as a “directional” signal unless you can manually verify the charts.

4.3 Solana explorer traces (important nuance)
Public Solscan snippets show one or more SPL tokens labeled “SIXR Cricket (SIXR)” with:
- Current supply: 1,000,000,000
- Decimals: 6
- First mint: Dec 22, 2025 (UTC) on at least one token address
These entries are tagged as “# Meme” in the Solscan snippet and appear on Solana.

Why this matters:
- Official messaging focuses on TON (Telegram + Linktree + TON wallet on the site), but there are also Solana tokens using the same name/ticker.
- Without an official, explicit statement mapping “the” official token contract addresses across chains, there is a non-trivial risk of confusing official tokens with imitators or unofficial “community/meme” deployments.

Practical due diligence:
- Verify the official contract addresses in an official announcement (website, verified social, pinned Telegram/X posts).
- Be cautious of multiple tokens with similar names/tickers and “meme” tags.

======================================================================
5) Company / Legal / Operations Signals
======================================================================
5.1 Corporate operator and jurisdiction (privacy policy PDF)
SIXR’s Privacy Policy PDF states:
- Host/Operator: “Liberty Gaming- FZCO”
- Incorporated under UAE laws; principal place of business: Dubai Silicon Oasis, Dubai, UAE
The policy also describes:
- Data collected (contact info, credentials/profile, payment info via processors, device/IP data, cookies/local storage)
- Purposes (operate service, account management, security/fraud, payments, marketing where permitted)
- Sharing with service providers; disclosures required by law; business transfers
- International transfers and use of safeguards aligned with GDPR concepts
- Contact: info@sixrcricket.com

This provides higher-confidence signals that there is a formal operator behind the website.

======================================================================
6) Community & Go-To-Market
======================================================================
6.1 Core channels
- Telegram channel: positions SIXR as a Web3 cricket ecosystem on TON; links to community chat @sixrcommunity.
- Linktree: highlights TON positioning and points to Discord and other social accounts.
- Website: push to a waitlist (country selection, 18+ confirmation, interest selection).

6.2 Growth mechanics
- “First Innings” tasks + referrals + leaderboard strongly resemble an airdrop/quest-based acquisition funnel.
- Press release challenges (#SIXRChallenge) and time-boxed collectibles suggest periodic engagement “drops”.

======================================================================
7) Competitive Landscape (high-level)
SIXR sits at the intersection of:
- Mobile/social cricket games (traditional)
- Telegram distribution + play-to-earn (Web3)
- Sports collectibles/NFT drops
- “SportsFi” messaging (ownership + token incentives)

Key differentiator claim: “play, compete, connect with legends inside Telegram” + tokenized ownership (TON wallet marketplace).

======================================================================
8) Risks, Unknowns, and Red Flags to Watch
======================================================================
8.1 Token identity ambiguity (TON vs Solana tokens)
- Official channels emphasize TON, but Solscan shows multiple Solana tokens using the SIXR Cricket name/ticker.
- Until SIXR publishes contract addresses clearly, assume there is a meaningful spoofing/confusion risk.

8.2 Limited technical documentation publicly
- The main site is marketing/feature-focused.
- No public audits, smart-contract docs, or technical whitepaper were found in the primary sources surfaced here.

8.3 Financial mechanics claims (“lending/borrowing” with Gems collateral)
- The site mentions decentralized lending/borrowing using gems as collateral for cash.
- This is high-risk if implemented on-chain without clear audit/terms; it can also introduce regulatory exposure depending on jurisdictions.

8.4 Reliance on campaigns / airdrop-style onboarding
- If the product’s traction is driven mainly by quests/airdrops, user retention may drop post-campaign unless the core game is strong.

======================================================================
9) What to Verify Next (Checklist)
======================================================================
A) Product reality
- Is the “game” already playable as a Telegram mini-app, or still pre-launch?
- What are the exact gameplay mechanics and fairness/security controls?

B) Token & assets
- Official $SIXR contract addresses (TON jetton, Solana SPL, or others)
- Token distribution schedule and unlocks (from the dashboard, verified directly)
- Marketplace(s) for NFTs and in-game assets; royalty structure; custody model

C) Team & entity
- Full team roster beyond the CEO quote (Ahad Bhai)
- Corporate registration and brand ownership (Liberty Gaming-FZCO)

D) Security / compliance
- Smart-contract audits (if any)
- Terms of service / disclaimers beyond the privacy policy
- KYC/AML stance if “cash” or fiat on/off ramps are involved
