0) QUICK FACTS (at a glance)
================================================================================
Brand: Tria (also shown as “useTria” on X)
Positioning (consumer): “self‑custodial neobank” that unifies spend, trade, and earn
                         across chains without users thinking about gas/bridges/seeds.
Positioning (developer): chain abstraction SDKs to build chain-abstracted apps/rollups
                         that “harness users and liquidity from all VMs”.
Key tech pillar: BestPath AVS (intents marketplace + routing/settlement layer).
Underlying network concept: “Unchained” (an AVS L2 described as Arbitrum Orbit + MoveVM).

================================================================================
1) WHAT TRIA IS (plain-English)
================================================================================
Tria is best understood as two tightly-coupled products:

(1) A consumer “wallet + neobank” interface:
    - a self-custodial wallet experience
    - spending via Tria Cards (Visa-branded in some comms) with broad token top-ups
    - yield/earn features (on-chain strategies)
    - trading features (swap, perps, cross-chain routing)
    - optional bank-account rails (“US bank account” is listed on the website)

(2) A chain-abstraction infrastructure stack for developers:
    - embedded/shared wallets + onboarding
    - cross-VM composability (EVM, Solana VM, Cosmos/IBC, Bitcoin, MoveVM)
    - intents-based routing (BestPath AVS) for swaps, payments, and multi-step actions
    - decentralized identity primitives (@tria DIDs) to unify reputation and accounts

In short: Tria wants “crypto UX like Revolut/Monzo” while keeping user self-custody,
and it aims to do that by abstracting chain differences (VMs), liquidity fragmentation,
and gas friction behind an intents + routing + wallet infrastructure.

================================================================================
2) THE PROBLEMS TRIA TARGETS
================================================================================
A) User continuity & onboarding friction
- New users struggle with seed phrases, multiple wallet types, and chain switching.

B) Asset fragmentation
- Assets and liquidity spread across chains and VMs create “bridge/swap/gas” burdens.

C) Multi-VM interoperability is hard for developers
- Building a dApp for one VM can leave out users from other ecosystems.

Tria’s docs explicitly frame the rise of appchains and ecosystems as creating
fragmentation and inconsistent UX across chains/VMs, motivating chain abstraction.

================================================================================
3) PRODUCT SURFACE AREA — CONSUMER SIDE
================================================================================
Based on the public website + web app landing + app store listings, Tria markets
the following consumer capabilities:

A) Wallet (self-custodial, “seedless” onboarding)
- “seedless, self‑custodial, gasless platform” messaging appears on the web-app landing.
- Supports advanced vs simplified modes: docs describe an interface where users can
  toggle between a “high-frequency trading terminal” and a simpler everyday wallet.

B) Swap / cross-chain trading
- Website markets “smart, automatic, cross-chain swaps” and “gas-free” routing,
  and ties this to BestPath.

C) Perps / leverage trading
- Website includes “PERPS” as a core feature, framed as “cross-chain leverage trading”
  with “unified routing” via BestPath.

D) Earn / yield
- Website markets “transparent yield from self-custodial onchain strategies”.
- Web app landing mentions “earn yields up to 15%” (claim).

E) Cards (spend crypto in the real world)
- Website claims spending in 150+ countries and topping up with 1,000+ tokens.
- Website lists card types and highlights Apple Pay / Google Pay, cashback, large limits,
  and access to yield products.

F) Rewards / points program
- Website highlights “Tria Points: Season 1 Live” and “Earn XP every time you use and
  share Tria… Real usage. Real rewards.”

G) “US Bank Account”
- Website lists “Open a US bank account from anywhere” among core features. Details
  and availability should be verified in legal docs / product UI.

Practical note:
- Consumer-facing claims (APY, card coverage, limits) can vary by region, compliance,
  and partner rails. Always verify in the app + terms.

================================================================================
4) PRODUCT SURFACE AREA — DEVELOPER SIDE (SDKs)
================================================================================
Tria’s docs position “front-end, plug-and-play SDKs” to build chain-abstracted
applications and rollups.

CoreSDK = Inception SDK + Mazerunner SDK
- Inception SDK: onboarding + shared embedded wallet infrastructure (SSO / passkeys).
- Mazerunner SDK: chain abstraction for dApps so users from other chains/VMs can
  interface “without bridging” or “paying gas” on the dApp chain.

CoreSDK capabilities enumerated in docs include:
- Shared wallet and assets across dApps and chains/VMs
- Multi-chain coverage: EVM, SVM, IBC, BTC, MoveVM
- Onboard with SSO + EOA wallets
- Commerce automation + onramp in “190+ countries” (claim in docs list)
- Seedless + non-custodial
- Gas abstraction + aggregated assets across chains
- Multi-platform support: JS/React/Next/Flutter/Unity/Unreal (availability varies)

Login methods (from docs)
- Social logins (Google, X, Facebook, Discord, Apple, etc.)
- Magic links / mobile
- @tria DIDs
- External wallets (MetaMask, Phantom, Keplr, WalletConnect, etc.)

Integration options referenced
- Getting started + React SDK + React Native SDK + multi-platform SDK
- Headless integration patterns + recipe pages (authentication, wallet interactions, UI)

================================================================================
5) TRIA’S “CHAIN ABSTRACTION” THESIS
================================================================================
Tria frames chain abstraction as:
- letting users use assets from one chain/VM to interact in another chain/VM
- without the legacy user flows (manual bridge → swap → gas management)
- while keeping the developer’s app deployed on a chain of their choice

A simple way to visualize Tria’s approach:
User intent (e.g., “swap and pay”, “open/close position”, “purchase item”)
   → Tria resolves identity + permissions + wallet state
   → BestPath marketplace computes optimal execution path
   → Multi-step transactions are automatically constructed and executed across VMs
   → Users experience a “one click” flow

================================================================================
6) ARCHITECTURE (what the docs describe)
================================================================================
The docs describe a set of interacting components:

A) Unchained (restaked L2 concept)
- Described as an AVS Layer 2 built on Arbitrum Orbit and MoveVM, with BestPath operating
  in shared state with Unchained.
- A “tripartite architecture” is described for chain abstraction operations.

B) TSS Network (Threshold Signature Scheme)
- Tria describes using a TSS network for verifiable, distributed signing rather than
  centralized key custody, aiming to avoid PKI-style single points of failure.

C) BestPath AVS (intents marketplace)
- A permissionless chain abstraction & intents marketplace AVS where “PathFinders”
  run strategies/simulations across VMs/wallet types and compete to provide execution
  paths. Incentives are tied to verifiably efficient execution (Pareto-optimal scheme).

D) CoreSDK security model
- Docs state a separation between authentication interface and wallet interface to
  protect auth layers from frontend interference.
- Post-auth tokens stored securely within an iFrame, coupled to the session context.
- Use of hardware-based TEEs / secure enclaves on supported devices; rotating key pairs
  and access tokens are isolated so transaction-related tokens remain in enclave memory.

E) Reference transaction flow (step-by-step)
Docs describe a reference flow that includes:
1) Initiation: user tx via CoreSDK/consumer interface or programmable trigger.
2) DID lookup (if applicable) via DID registry on Unchained using a TheGraph resolver.
3) Permissioning + tx object creation: read Access Control Conditions and use a
   Programmable Key Pair (PKP) state for automation approvals.
4) Intent sent to PathFinders in BestPath; PathFinders propose best execution paths.
5) Construct transaction; TSS nodes sign automations; broadcast to destination chain;
   fee rewards to winning PathFinder; DA commitments to Ethereum mainnet are described.

================================================================================
7) DECENTRALIZED IDENTITIES (DIDs) — “@tria”
================================================================================
Tria positions identities as the “atomic natural entity” for onboarding and wallet
management across chains.

Key DID features (from docs):
- A blockchain-agnostic identity framework formatted like name@root (e.g., joe@tria).
- Mapping service that associates a human-readable alias with wallet addresses across
  blockchains (forward + reverse resolution inside dApps).
- Non-EVM address association supported (multi-chain DID service).
- DIDs as NFTs: docs say @tria DIDs are NFTs minted on Unchained; minting triggers an
  on-chain NFT mint and can enable a marketplace for identities.
- Mentions CAIP-275 “login with name” initiative and domain-based authentication.
- Positions DIDs as an “enclave for zk credentials” (reputation graphs, zk-KYC), enabling
  selective disclosure via zk-proofs.

================================================================================
8) SUPPORTED NETWORKS (SDK) — what’s listed publicly
================================================================================
Tria publishes a “Supported Networks” list (last updated April 25, 2024) with a
notation for “GA” (gas abstraction support).

Mainnet networks listed include (selection):
- Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche, BSC, Solana (noted as “In Prod”)
- Several “In Staging” / “In Prod” networks like ZkLink Nova, Bitlayer, Injective, TON
- Cosmos shown as “In Dev”

Testnets include:
- Sepolia, Amoy, and multiple others (some in staging/prod) including Solana devnet,
  Injective testnet, etc.

Note: Since the list is dated 2024, you should verify current coverage in the latest
docs/UI or by contacting Tria’s team.

================================================================================
9) BUSINESS MODEL (how Tria likely makes money)
================================================================================
Tria doesn’t publish a complete revenue breakdown on the surfaced pages, but typical
models for this product category include:

Consumer revenue levers
- interchange / card program revenue share
- spreads or fees on swaps and perps routing (via BestPath or partners)
- yield product fees (performance/management) depending on strategies
- premium membership tiers (if offered; some secondary sources mention tiers)

Infrastructure revenue levers (B2B / dev)
- SDK / embedded wallet infra fees (per MAU, per tx, or SaaS-like)
- intents marketplace fees / solver fees / routing margins
- “paymaster” services for gas abstraction (sponsor txs and recover fees)

================================================================================
10) FUNDING & TRACTION SIGNALS (public claims)
================================================================================
A) Funding (press release claim)
A Cointelegraph-hosted paid press release (Chainwire) states Tria raised $12M in
pre-seed and strategic funding and lists several participants and advisors. This is
marketing content, not independent reporting.

B) Traction (press release claims)
The same release claims:
- Tria Cards function in 150+ countries and support 1,000+ tokens
- BestPath routes payments and trades for “over 250K users” and is “used by 70+ protocols”
Treat these as claims until corroborated elsewhere.

================================================================================
11) SECURITY, PRIVACY, AND COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS
================================================================================
A) Custody & key management
- Tria positions itself as self-custodial; still, embedded wallets introduce
  implementation details you must review (key shares, recovery flows, device binding,
  TEE assumptions, iFrame isolation boundaries).

B) Threshold cryptography & AVS security
- BestPath is framed as an AVS (EigenLayer model) and uses staking/slashing logic.
  You should verify which parts are live today vs conceptual or “redacted” in docs.

C) Card + bank rails = regulated surface
- Cards and bank accounts require partners, KYC/AML, and jurisdiction restrictions.
  Read Tria’s legal pages and card terms for your region.

D) App data collection
- Google Play lists the app as collecting/sharing certain data categories.
- Apple App Store lists tracking and linked/not-linked data categories and points to
  a privacy policy (Notion link).

================================================================================
12) COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (context)
================================================================================
Closest product categories:
- Self-custodial “neobank” wallets with cards (e.g., other crypto card + wallet stacks)
- Embedded wallet providers (privy-like), account abstraction wallets, and paymaster infra
- Cross-chain “intents” / routing networks (solver marketplaces)
- Chain-abstraction SDK platforms targeting multi-VM onboarding

Tria’s differentiation, as positioned:
- Multi-VM scope (EVM + SVM + IBC + BTC + MoveVM)
- BestPath AVS marketplace framing (permissionless pathfinders + incentives)
- Identity-first onboarding via @tria DIDs + zk credentials narrative

================================================================================
13) RED FLAGS / RISKS (what to check before trusting it)
================================================================================
- Are “redacted” sections hiding critical trust assumptions?
- What is live today vs roadmap? (Docs mention private circulation and redacted details.)
- How decentralized is BestPath in practice (operator set, slashing conditions, DA layer)?
- How are “gasless” transactions funded and priced?
- What partners power card/banking rails, and what are the terms?
- What happens on failure: dispute resolution, refunds, chargebacks, failed routes?
- How does Tria mitigate MEV or solver manipulation in routing?

================================================================================
14) WHAT TO DO NEXT (practical evaluation plan)
================================================================================
If you’re doing diligence, here’s a high-signal sequence:

1) Product test (consumer)
   - Create an account, test onboarding, recovery, and small transactions.
   - Validate cross-chain swaps and gas abstraction behavior (who pays fees and how).
   - Check card availability, limits, fees, and KYC requirements.

2) Technical review (developer)
   - Read CoreSDK docs and try a sandbox integration.
   - Check supported networks + whether your target chain has GA support.
   - Validate key custody model: where are key shares stored; recovery and rotation.

3) Trust & security
   - Look for audits (not surfaced in this crawl), bug bounty, and incident history.
   - Understand which components are “permissionless” today.
