Quick Positioning (what it appears to be)
Zetarium World presents itself as a BNB Chain-based “permissionless” DeFi ecosystem combining:
- a public staking system (any project can create staking pools),
- a permissionless bond system (projects can open bond vaults to raise liquidity),
- a perpetual DEX, and
- a prediction market (testnet referenced).
(See BNB Chain’s DappBay listing for the most explicit, consolidated description of these components.)

Important note about name confusion
There is also an unrelated website “zetarium.com” describing an agricultural insurance company using satellite data and AI.
This report is about “Zetarium World” at zetarium.world (DeFi / Web3).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Zetarium World’s core claim is “permissionless financial infrastructure” on BNB Chain: projects can raise liquidity and build token-economy loops using bonds and staking without centralized approval. The product suite expands beyond “capital formation primitives” (bond + stake) into user-facing trading (perps) and a prediction market.

From a due diligence perspective, the most concrete, verifiable artifacts today are:
- The BNB Chain DappBay listing (product description + audit link + categories).
- The on-chain ZET token contract on BscScan (verified source code and token supply).
- The “zetarium-contracts” GitHub repository (describes staking and vesting-sale factory contracts, signature systems, and security patterns).
- Public partnership announcements (e.g., Tilted blog post) that reference Zetarium’s token and infrastructure positioning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2) WHAT PROBLEM THEY CLAIM TO SOLVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Stated pain points (inferred from official positioning & DappBay listing):
- Fragmented liquidity and fragmented DeFi primitives.
- Projects struggling to create sustainable, transparent yield incentives.
- Projects raising liquidity via centralized or permissioned methods.

Zetarium’s approach:
- Permissionless bond vaults (raise liquidity directly from community).
- Permissionless staking pools (community-oriented yield, transparent on-chain accounting).
- Expand ecosystem activity with perps + prediction markets.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3) PRODUCTS & MODULES (User-facing)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1) “Public Stake” (permissionless staking pools)
What it is:
- A public staking system where projects can create staking pools for their tokens, enabling transparent yield generation.

Why it matters:
- Lets ecosystems bootstrap liquidity/retention via APR-based rewards.
- Potentially provides a standardized staking infrastructure for partner tokens.

Key implementation clues (from Zetarium contracts repo):
- Factory pattern deploys individual StakingPool contracts.
- Rewards calculated per-second (APR basis points).
- Creation and certain staking paths can require backend signature validation (see “Backend Signature Validation” / “Quote-Based Staking”).

Risks / tradeoffs:
- Backend signature flows introduce trust dependencies (central signer / quote issuer).
- Reward solvency depends on the “reward reserve system” and pool owner funding.

3.2) “Permissionless Bonds”
What it is:
- Projects open public bond vaults to raise liquidity without centralized approval.

How bonds typically work (general DeFi framing):
- Users deposit an asset (e.g., stablecoin/BNB/LP) and receive discounted tokens that vest over time.
- Bonds can create token sinks and predictable issuance schedules.

Implementation clues (from contracts repo):
- “VestingSalePlatform” factory deploys “VestingSale” contracts using linear vesting.
- Supports multiple payment currencies (ETH, USDT, USD1).
- Purchase requires backend-signed quote for pricing.
- Platform fee: 1% on proceeds (configurable).

Risks / tradeoffs:
- Quote-signature system implies off-chain pricing authority (centralization risk).
- Bond/vault terms and “discounts” can create heavy sell pressure if not designed carefully.

3.3) Perpetual DEX (“Perp DEX”)
What it is:
- DappBay describes a “Perpetual DEX (Perp DEX) … fully decentralized and non-custodial”.
- Separate branding appears as “ZDEX” via zdex.world.

Status visibility:
- ZDEX landing page is minimal from public scraping; functionality likely lives behind a web app.

Risks / tradeoffs:
- Perp DEXs are high-risk products: liquidation mechanics, oracle dependence, potential insurance fund risk.
- User protection depends heavily on audits, oracle design, and risk parameters.

3.4) Prediction Market (PredictX — testnet referenced)
What it is:
- PredictX is described as “Decentralized Prediction Market Testnet. Predict the future, earn rewards.”

Status visibility:
- The markets page is heavily dynamic (content not easily retrievable as text), but the project positions it as a core component alongside perps and capital formation primitives.

Risks / tradeoffs:
- Prediction markets require careful market resolution, dispute mechanisms, and oracle sources.
- Liquidity fragmentation can be severe without incentives.

3.5) Swap / Spot DEX interface
What it is:
- Zetarium hosts a /swap path and markets itself as “The next generation DeFi platform for bonds and staking. Built on BNB Chain.”
This suggests at least a spot interface (or a router integration) to enable token swaps inside the ecosystem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4) TOKEN: ZET (On-chain facts + likely utility)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1) Contract + supply (verifiable on-chain)
- Token: “Zetarium (ZET)”
- Chain: BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20)
- Verified contract: 0x87a659e946beee8e6948a42f54cd04e3aa24ded0
- Max total supply shown on BscScan: 100,000,000 ZET
- Source code indicates the constructor mints 100M ZET to the owner address.

Observations:
- The token contract shown on BscScan is a simple ERC20 + Ownable token (no visible tax/fee mechanics in the snippet displayed).
- BscScan also displays a small holder count at the time of crawling; verify current holders and transfers directly on BscScan.

4.2) Token utility (stated / implied)
Across public descriptions and partner content, $ZET is described as powering:
- governance and utility,
- staking and rewards loops,
- bonds / token sale or liquidity-raising primitives.

Important: Token utility and tokenomics allocations (team, ecosystem, treasury, etc.) are not fully verifiable from a single authoritative “official” document from the sources retrieved as plain text here. Treat third-party tokenomics pages as directional unless confirmed by official docs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5) TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (From public code)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The strongest “real” technical signal is the open GitHub repo:
- ZetariumWorld/zetarium-contracts

5.1) Factory pattern
Both staking and vesting-sale systems use a factory pattern:
- Factory contract deploys child contracts (staking pools or vesting sales).
- Factory keeps registries/metadata and can track user participation.

5.2) Signature / quote system (central to their design)
The contracts README describes:
- Backend Signature Validation for pool creation.
- Quote-based staking (stakeWithQuote) requiring a backend-signed quote.
- VestingSale purchases require backend-signed quotes.
Signatures include chain ID, user address, nonce, deadline to prevent replay and cross-chain reuse.

Design implication:
- Some core flows rely on an off-chain component (a backend signer).
This can be used for compliance, risk controls, pricing logic, and spam prevention—but it also reduces “pure permissionless” guarantees.

5.3) Security patterns in the repo
Stated security features:
- Reentrancy protection
- OpenZeppelin libraries (Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20, ECDSA)
- Emergency withdrawal mechanism with a 24-hour timelock
- Sequential nonces and chain ID in signatures

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6) SECURITY / AUDITS (What’s visible)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.1) Coinsult audit link (via BNB Chain DappBay listing)
BNB Chain’s DappBay listing includes an “Audit” link pointing to Coinsult, referencing the ZET contract address.

6.2) On-chain verified source + “Developed by Coinsult” header
The BscScan verified source code for the ZET token includes a comment header indicating “Developed by Coinsult” (as displayed in the verified code snippet).

What you should do (practical due diligence checklist):
- Open the Coinsult audit link and read the full report (severity, scope, resolved items).
- Verify the scope includes not just the token, but staking/bond/perps contracts if those are separate contracts.
- Verify contract addresses used by the app match the audited/verified addresses.
- Check admin roles and upgradeability patterns (if any) for protocol contracts beyond the token.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7) PARTNERSHIPS, ECOSYSTEM SIGNALS, AND “SOCIAL PROOF”
--------------------------------------------------------------------
These items are mostly “announcements”, not technical guarantees. Still, they can help gauge GTM strategy.

7.1) Tilted partnership (high-signal: detailed blog post)
Tilted published a blog post describing a partnership with Zetarium, positioning Zetarium as “decentralized infrastructure protocol” with staking, bonds, and the $ZET token. This is one of the clearest long-form partnership pieces available.

7.2) SPACE ID partnership (reported by multiple outlets)
Several crypto news/flash outlets reported Zetarium partnering with SPACE ID to integrate Web3 identity into Zetarium’s DeFi stack on BNB Chain (timing: mid/late Dec 2025). Look for a first-party confirmation on Zetarium’s X/Telegram and/or SPACE ID channels.

7.3) WORLD3 partnership (reported + X-quote referenced)
Reports describe Zetarium partnering with WORLD3 around early Dec 2025 to develop AI agents / automation capabilities.

7.4) INTO partnership (Telegram channel references)
Zetarium’s Telegram channel has posts referencing collaboration with INTO, with language around expanding decentralized liquidity and seamless Web3 interactions.

7.5) Additional mentions (lower-signal)
Various aggregators/exchange news pages mention other integrations/partners (e.g., Cache Wallet). Treat these as leads to verify via first-party announcements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
8) ROADMAP / STAGE (What can be inferred)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Without a fully-readable official roadmap page (site is dynamic), stage clues come from:
- The presence of testnet (PredictX).
- Airdrop / “engage & predict to earn” campaigns mentioned in public sources.
- Low on-chain activity/holders shown on token explorer at time of crawl (needs verification in real time).
- Ongoing partnership announcements (Nov–Dec 2025) suggesting active marketing and ecosystem build-up.

Likely stage characterization:
- Pre-TGE / early ecosystem build (inferred; confirm via official channels).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
9) USER JOURNEYS (How people would actually use it)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
9.1) If you’re a “normal DeFi user”
- Acquire ZET (or interact via the swap).
- Stake tokens in pools (potentially ZET or partner tokens).
- Participate in bond sales (purchase discounted tokens with vesting).
- Trade perps on the Perp DEX (if available in your region and you understand liquidation risks).
- Use prediction markets (testnet suggests experimentation/points).

9.2) If you’re a “token project / ecosystem”
- Create staking pools to bootstrap holders and yield loops.
- Open bond vaults (vesting sales) to raise liquidity.
- Use Zetarium’s infrastructure for “token launch + liquidity + retention” loops.

9.3) If you’re an “airdrop farmer / growth participant”
- Participate in “engage/predict” tasks if available.
- Expect typical friction: wallet linking, social tasks, points syncing, anti-bot checks, referral systems.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
10) RISKS & RED FLAGS TO CHECK (extra care)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A) “Permissionless” vs “backend signatures”
If pool creation and purchase/stake flows require backend signatures, the protocol has an off-chain trust dependency. This isn’t automatically bad, but it changes censorship-resistance assumptions.

B) Audit scope
An audit link exists, but you must confirm:
- which contracts were audited,
- whether the deployed contracts match audited commits/addresses,
- whether critical issues were fixed.

C) Admin/owner keys
- Token contract has an “owner” in code.
- Factories may have owners with emergency control functions.
You should review admin powers, timelocks, and whether there’s an upgrade proxy.

D) Low observable on-chain metrics (at time of crawl)
Explorer data showed low holder counts for ZET at the snapshot time. This can mean early stage, but it’s a signal to verify distribution, lockups, vesting, and liquidity.

E) Perps & prediction markets
These are high-risk. Oracle design, liquidation, and market resolution are common failure modes.

F) Brand/name collisions
“Zetarium” exists as a separate agri-insurance company on zetarium.com. Ensure you’re following the correct project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
11) COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (context)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Capital formation primitives:
- Bond Protocol / Olympus-style bonds
- Launchpad + vesting sale platforms
- Staking-as-a-service (e.g., various DeFi staking pool frameworks)

Perp DEX:
- GMX-style perps (oracle-based)
- Orderbook-based perps on other chains

Prediction markets:
- Polymarket (off-chain orderbooks but huge liquidity)
- Augur-style on-chain markets
- Newer “points + prediction” gamified markets

Zetarium’s differentiation claim:
- “All-in-one” permissionless ecosystem on BNB Chain combining bonds + staking + trading + prediction.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
12) WHAT I WOULD VERIFY NEXT (if you want maximum certainty)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Read the Zetarium whitepaper PDF (linked from CoinMarketCap) and confirm:
   - token allocation, vesting, emissions
   - protocol revenue model
   - governance model
   - exact roadmap milestones

2) Review deployed contracts:
   - staking factory address(es), pool addresses
   - vesting sale factory address(es), active sales
   - perps contracts / protocol if on-chain
   - prediction market contracts (or off-chain?)

3) Confirm partnerships from first-party channels:
   - Zetarium Telegram announcements
   - Zetarium X posts
   - Partner X/blog posts

4) Check liquidity + markets:
   - DEX liquidity depth for ZET
   - any CEX listings (if claimed)
   - market maker arrangements (if claimed)
