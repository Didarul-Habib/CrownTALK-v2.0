[ONE_LINER]
idOS is an identity “digital vault” network where users store encrypted credentials (starting with reusable KYC)
and selectively share access with apps via onchain-like permissioned “Access Grants”.

[WHY_IT_MATTERS]
Stablecoin/fintech apps repeatedly collect KYC into centralized silos. idOS aims to make identity portable:
user-controlled encrypted credentials + selective disclosure → less re-onboarding, less data honeypots.

[CORE_COMPONENTS]
- Storage Network (L1): decentralized data storage/retrieval layer built on Kwil (decentralized database) + idOS schema/extensions.
- Economy Network (PLANNED): Arbitrum Orbit chain intended to meter usage + implement fees/incentives (“data economy”).
- SDKs + Apps: SDKs for issuers/consumers; idOS App + dashboards for users.

[ACTORS]
- USER/OWNER: controls idOS Profile (digital vault) and grants access.
- ISSUER: verifies info and issues signed credentials (VC-like).
- CONSUMER: requests access; can read only after user grants permission.

[KEY_FLOWS]
- Onboard: wallet connect → key setup (often MPC) → issuer writes signed credential to user vault.
- View: dashboard fetches encrypted data → user decrypts via enclave boundary.
- Share: consumer requests credential → user approves → Access Grant created → consumer reads permitted data.

[PRIVACY_SECURITY]
- Enclave boundary: sensitive operations (key derivation, encrypt/decrypt, plaintext viewing) happen in separate-origin enclave so host apps can’t see plaintext.
- Data encrypted to user keys; storage operators can’t read plaintext without user-granted access.

[UNIQUENESS_FACESIGN]
- FaceSign (Beta) focuses on duplicate prevention / uniqueness proof.
- Uses non-reversible face vectors; matching runs inside AWS Nitro Enclaves (per docs).
- Future plan mentioned: migrate compute from Nitro Enclaves to MPC network.
NOTE: This is uniqueness/anti-duplication, not “identity” by itself.

[KEY_MANAGEMENT]
- Per-user encryption keypair; public key recorded on profile; credentials encrypted to user key.
- Options described:
  - Password-based derivation (older/alternative).
  - MPC-based key creation (recommended default per blog) using PartisiaBlockchain; wallet signing, no extra passwords.

[NETWORK_STATUS]
- Described as permissioned today (authorized operators).
- Roadmap: progressive decentralization later (KYB’d operators, stake-weighting, potential sharding).

[TOKEN_FACTS]
- Token: IDOS (ERC-20) on Arbitrum One.
- Total supply: 1,000,000,000 IDOS.
- Community-heavy allocation (docs mention ~41.3%).
- Staking rewards: 15% over ~10 years (emissions schedule described in blog).
- Timeline note: materials suggest shifting expectations (older: Q4 2025; newer statement: mid Q1 2026).

[FEES_MODEL]
- Today: integration costs described as limited/none (per FAQ context).
- Planned: fees for reads/writes + Access Grants when Economy Network is live.
- Docs mention protocol cut of Access Grant fees: 25%.

[SAFE_ANGLES]
ANGLE_IMPLEMENTATION_Q:
Ask one precise implementation question about access grants, revocation, expiry, or issuer/consumer flows.

ANGLE_TRADEOFF:
Highlight one tradeoff: permissioned operators now vs decentralization later; enclave/MPC trust boundaries.

ANGLE_ARCH_LINK:
Connect tweet to a concrete mechanism: enclave boundary, Access Grants, Kwil storage, MPC keys.

ANGLE_ADOPTION:
Comment on adoption wedge: reusable KYC for stablecoin UX; issuer network + integrations as moat.

[DO_NOT_SAY]
No token price, “moon”, “pump”, trading calls.
No claiming partnerships/integrations unless tweet explicitly states it.
No calling it “launched/mainnet/live” unless tweet clearly says so.
No blanket praise (“awesome/great”) unless tied to a specific mechanism or product detail.
If unsure: ask a sharp question instead of asserting.

[COMMENT_RULES]
- Must include 1–2 ANCHORS when relevant to tweet context.
- Must reference something from the tweet OR a mechanism listed above (no generic compliments).
- 10–28 words preferred; never cut mid-sentence.
- If it’s a question, end with “?”.
- One thought only (no multi-paragraph).
- No emojis unless tweet tone is casual (max 1).

[NOTES_FOR_GENERATOR]
If tweet is vague: choose ANGLE_IMPLEMENTATION_Q and ask about Access Grant lifecycle or issuer coverage.
If tweet is technical: choose ANGLE_ARCH_LINK and mention enclave boundary / encryption / Kwil / MPC.
If tweet is roadmap/launch: choose ANGLE_TRADEOFF or ANGLE_ADOPTION; keep claims strictly within tweet text.
