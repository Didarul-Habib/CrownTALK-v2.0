===============================================================================
idOS (“identity operating system”) is a decentralized storage + access management network designed to make identity data (starting with reusable KYC) portable across the “stablecoin economy”. It aims to let users hold encrypted credentials in a personal “digital vault” (idOS Profile), and selectively grant access to apps/businesses via onchain “Access Grants”. The system is built around:
  • idOS Storage Network (L1): decentralized data storage layer built on Kwil (decentralized database), run by node operators.
  • idOS Economy Network (coming soon): an Arbitrum Orbit chain that meters usage and implements the data‑economy / incentives via smart contracts.
  • SDKs + Apps: developer SDKs plus the idOS App (user dashboard) and enclave tooling for encryption/decryption.

Primary market thesis: stablecoin apps need compliant, privacy‑preserving identity re‑use. idOS positions itself as infrastructure for that.

===============================================================================
1) Problem framing & value proposition
===============================================================================
1.1 The pain
• Today, KYC/AML and other identity checks are repeatedly performed and stored in siloed, centralized “honeypots”. Users re-submit sensitive data and businesses duplicate liability.
• In stablecoin/crypto fintech flows, onboarding often requires regulated identity proofs across multiple services (on/off-ramps, neobanks, cards, exchanges, etc.). Reusability is hard because there’s no shared, user-controlled identity layer.

1.2 idOS’s pitch (what they claim)
• “Portable identity” for stablecoin apps: users can onboard and share identity “as easily as moving their money”.
• Self-custodial data: end‑to‑end encryption with user-controlled keys; storage nodes and even idOS can’t read plaintext without user-granted access.
• Verifiable Credentials approach: issuers sign structured credentials; consumers verify authenticity while access is permissioned by the user.

===============================================================================
2) Core architecture (how it works)
===============================================================================
2.1 Main network components
A) Storage Network (L1)
• A decentralized L1 data layer responsible for data storage/retrieval, authentication, consensus, encryption/signing support, and RPC load balancing.
• Built on Kwil (decentralized database) plus idOS-specific extensions and schema.

B) Economy Network (coming soon)
• Planned as an Arbitrum Orbit chain.
• Implements the “data economy” in smart contracts and meters Storage Network usage.
• Intended to bring fees / incentives, progressive decentralization, and more open node operation.

C) SDKs and application layer
• SDKs for issuers and consumers (apps) to integrate create/read/write flows, issue credentials, request access, etc.
• User-facing idOS App + dashboards.

2.2 Key actors in the system (roles)
• Owner (User): controls a profile (“digital vault”) and grants access. Auth with blockchain wallets.
• Issuer: verifies user data and issues signed credentials (e.g., KYC provider or regulated entity).
• Consumer: requests access to credentials; can only read after user grants permission.

2.3 The “Enclave” model (privacy boundary)
idOS uses an “idOS Enclave” concept: a separate-origin web app environment for sensitive cryptographic operations (password input, key derivation, encrypt/decrypt, viewing decrypted credential contents) so host apps cannot access plaintext.

2.4 Key flows (high level)
• New user onboarding: user connects wallet, initializes encryption keys via the enclave, profile created, issuer writes signed credential.
• Viewing/updating data: dashboard reads encrypted data; user decrypts through enclave.
• Sharing data: user creates an Access Grant to a consumer; data is re-encrypted for the recipient/consumer as needed.

===============================================================================
3) Identity & uniqueness (biometrics, “FaceSign”)
===============================================================================
idOS includes a “FaceSign” (Beta) mechanism aimed at proving a user is a unique human and preventing duplicates:
• Uses “FaceVector” representations (non-reversible vectors). The docs say actual video/images are deleted inside the secure enclave after vector creation.
• Stores no face photos in idOS; instead stores an encrypted credential containing a unique ID (issuer-signed VC), readable only via user-granted access.
• Runs matching inside AWS Nitro Enclaves (isolated VMs without external networking; no shell access).
• Mentions future plan to move compute from Nitro Enclaves to an MPC network.

Important nuance:
• This is “biometrics for uniqueness” within their onboarding; it’s not “identity” by itself, but a component to prevent multiple profiles claiming the same person (while still allowing multiple profiles under the same “same-person” proof).

===============================================================================
4) Key management & encryption (MPC + password options)
===============================================================================
4.1 Per-user encryption keys
• Each user has their own encryption keypair; user public key is recorded on the idOS profile; all credential content is encrypted to that user.
• Enclave must be able to recreate private keys reliably for web apps (which can’t store secrets like browser extensions do).

4.2 Approaches described
• Password-based key derivation (earlier option): user chooses a password; used as input to key derivation to recreate keys.
• MPC-based key creation (recommended default in the idOS App, per blog): built with PartisiaBlockchain. The app can generate keys via wallet signing without additional passwords/seed phrases.

===============================================================================
5) Network model: permissioned today, decentralization later
===============================================================================
System design docs describe idOS as currently “permissioned”:
• Only authorized operators can participate initially, enabling real-world accountability.
• It states the intent to progressively decentralize: when Economy Network is live, node operators would be KYB’d by the idOS Association and added based on stake weight; they also mention exploring sharding to enable more permissionless validation.

===============================================================================
6) Token (IDOS): supply, allocation, vesting, campaigns
===============================================================================
6.1 Basics
• IDOS is an ERC‑20 token, first deployed on Arbitrum One.
• Fixed total supply: 1,000,000,000 IDOS.

6.2 Allocation overview (from official docs)
Community (41.3%)
  • Staking rewards: 15.0% (150M) — distributed across 10 years (120 months).
    - Emission schedule described in blog: Years 1–2: 30M/yr; Years 3–6: 15M/yr; Years 7–10: 7.5M/yr.
    - Rewards accrue daily and can be claimed any time.
    - Staking rewards expected to be complemented later by fees (Access Grants) used for buy-backs and added incentives.

  • 10% unlock on TDE; remaining 90% over 60 months linear vesting.

6.3 Sale mechanics: “FADE” (Fair Allocation & Discovery Engine)
The Community Sale used a mechanism called FADE:
• Tokens in Community Sale: 25,000,000 IDOS (2.5% of total supply).
• Price discovery range: contribution goal $500k up to max raise $2m.
• Price scales linearly between $0.02 and $0.08 based on total contribution amount.
• If oversubscribed above max raise, FADE finds an “individual cap” that maximizes distribution; excess above cap is returned.
• If demand is low and goal not reached, contributions are returned.

6.4 Community Sale results (reported by idOS)
• Subscription period: Nov 24, 2025 1:00 PM UTC – Nov 28, 2025 1:00 PM UTC (extended from Nov 26).
• Total tokens sold: 25,000,000 IDOS.
• Total contributed: $536,172.46 USDC.
• Participants: 871.
• Goal reached: 107.2% of $500k; Max cap reached: 26.8% of $2m.
• Oversubscription: No.
• Token delivery: on TDE; the post states “expected mid Q1 2026”.

Note on timeline consistency:
• Token allocation docs reference a TDE “expected Q4 2025”, while the sale-results post says expected “mid Q1 2026”. Treat mid‑Q1 2026 as the newer public statement.

===============================================================================
7) Fees, incentives & the “data economy”
===============================================================================
In the developer FAQ docs:
• Today: they claim no ongoing integration costs yet.
• Planned: once the Economy Network is live, issuers/consumers pay gas to node operators for reads/writes, and fees for Access Grants.
• The protocol intends to take a 25% cut of Access Grant fees, per developer FAQ.

===============================================================================
8) Product surface: apps, dashboard, and user journey
===============================================================================
8.1 idOS App (user-facing)
The “idOS App is live” announcement describes:
• Creating an idOS Profile (a “digital vault” storing encrypted credentials).
• Wallet support: currently EVM wallets; NEAR and XRPL “coming soon” in that post.
• Profile creation steps include:
  1) Create private key (default recommendation: MPC key creation with PartisiaBlockchain; wallet signing, no extra passwords).
  2) Verify identity uniqueness via basic video liveness check; says biometric images aren’t processed outside secured enclaves and aren’t stored.

8.2 Dashboard & profile
• There is a separate “User Dashboard” entry point (dashboard.idos.network) referenced on the website.
• The “idos-profile” URL you shared appears to be an app route for profile management; some routes may require wallet connection / auth.

8.3 Points / campaigns
• The token allocation blog indicates active campaigns include “idOS App quests” and a Wallchain campaign measuring “Mindshare” (quality-weighted social engagement metric).
• Legal disclaimers emphasize points have no monetary value, are non-transferable, and do not entitle users to tokens.

===============================================================================
9) Compliance, legal posture, and disclaimers (what they emphasize)
===============================================================================
9.1 MiCA framing
• Their disclaimers page explicitly frames certain communications as “marketing communication” about crypto-assets, not reviewed/approved by EU authorities, and references a MiCA white paper.

9.2 Restrictions
• The disclaimers mention restricted jurisdictions and that UK persons are excluded from some token-related activities and programs; participation may require AML/KYC.

9.3 Risk / no investment claims
• The disclaimers say IDOS token does not grant equity/ownership/profit rights, and that nothing should be treated as investment advice.

(Also note: the “Last update” on the disclaimers page shows “December 1, 2925”, which appears to be a typo on their site.)

===============================================================================
10) Open-source / code footprint & transparency signals
===============================================================================
10.1 GitHub
The idos-network GitHub org lists multiple public repositories, including:
• idos-sdk-js (TypeScript)
• idos-access-grants (contracts)
• idos-schema
• nitro-enclave-experiment (example of Nitro Enclave networking/proxy pattern)

10.2 What’s not public (yet)
System design docs mention some relevant repos are “not yet public” (e.g., an idos-kwild repo and KGW repo).

===============================================================================
11) Audits & security posture (what they say)
===============================================================================
• Developer FAQ says they engaged “Resonance” to audit their v1 release, scope limited to SDKs + their KwilDB implementation (not KwilDB itself), expected by end of May 2025 (per that doc section).
• Security docs emphasize operator KYB, encrypted data with user keys, and defense-in-depth.

===============================================================================
12) Ecosystem positioning (partners, consortium)
===============================================================================
• idOS presents itself as an industry-wide effort founded and funded by a consortium of ecosystems/industry players.
• In token allocation docs, they name multiple consortium contributors (Arbitrum Foundation, Circle, NEAR Foundation, Ripple Labs, Tezos Foundation, Radix Foundation, Gnosis, Aleph Zero Foundation, etc.).

===============================================================================
13) Competitive landscape (context, not exhaustive)
===============================================================================
Likely adjacent categories:
• DID + verifiable credentials platforms
• “Reusable KYC” networks and shared identity rails
• Traditional KYC providers building credential re-use products
• Privacy-preserving credential sharing in wallets (ZK credentials, selective disclosure)

idOS differentiators they emphasize:
• “Self-custodial” encrypted storage network + access grants.
• Compliance posture and stablecoin/fintech initial market focus.
• Enclave/MPC approach to key management and uniqueness verification.

===============================================================================
14) Risks, unknowns, and diligence checklist
===============================================================================
Technical / delivery risks
• Economy Network “coming soon”: core token fee flows and decentralization are dependent on this launch.
• Permissioned network today: decentralization roadmap matters for censorship resistance and trust assumptions.
• Biometrics: reliance on specific vendor/engine and Nitro enclaves; future MPC migration is aspirational.

Token / market risks
• TDE timing: public materials indicate shifting expectations (Q4 2025 vs mid‑Q1 2026).
• Unlocks/allocations: community-heavy distribution, but details like listings/liquidity reserve and treasury control matter for market dynamics.

Compliance / geo restrictions
• Restricted jurisdictions and KYC requirements limit participation.
• Disclaimers are explicit about no investment advice and high risk.

Diligence checklist (fast)
□ Read system design + key flows in docs; map trust boundaries.
□ Verify which repos are public and what code is actually shipped.
□ Confirm audit reports and scope (Resonance; any additional audits).
□ Track Economy Network timeline and whether access‑grant fee mechanics are live.
□ Review token legal white paper (PDF download) + MiCA materials.
□ Check app UX: profile creation, key recovery, access grant creation, and revocation flows.
