ALTURA TRADE (altura.trade) — Deep Dive (multi-angle review)
Last updated: 2026-01-10 (Asia/Dhaka)

IMPORTANT DISAMBIGUATION
- This report covers “Altura Trade” at https://www.altura.trade/ (and its docs at https://docs.altura.trade/), a USDT0 vault protocol on Hyperliquid/HyperEVM. citeturn18view0turn23view2
- There are other unrelated “Altura” entities online (e.g., gaming/NFT marketplace projects). Be careful not to mix them up when researching tickers like “ALU.” citeturn20search21turn22search16

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1) Project snapshot (what it is, in one page)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Altura positions itself as a non-custodial, multi-strategy yield protocol on Hyperliquid’s HyperEVM: users deposit USDT0, receive vault shares, and the protocol runs strategies “in the background” while an on-chain Price Per Share (PPS) increases as yield is realized. citeturn18view0turn23view2

Key claims & differentiators:
- “Single multi-strategy vault” where users deposit USDT0 and get vault shares (ownership % of vault). citeturn18view0turn23view2
- Yield sources framed as diversified/hedged and “not token emissions.” citeturn23view2turn18view1
- On-chain verifiability: balances, PPS updates, withdrawal queue, and asset flows intended to be observable on-chain. citeturn18view0turn19search2
- Layered security (oracle controls, access controls, timelocks, withdrawal safeguards) and multiple audits listed. citeturn18view0turn23view1turn26view0

Core primitives (as described in docs):
- Vault contract
- Share token (referred to in docs/UX as AVLT shares)
- Oracle reporter for PPS updates
- Role-based controls (pausing, governance, strategy execution)
- Withdrawal queue/epochs for orderly liquidity citeturn19search2turn18view0turn26view0

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2) Product & user experience (what a user does)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2.1 Deposit flow
Altura’s website describes this user path:
1) Deposit USDT0 on HyperEVM
2) Receive vault shares (represents exact ownership %)
3) Protocol deploys strategies automatically
4) PPS increases as yield is generated
5) Withdraw anytime (but note a minimum waiting period after deposit before withdrawals can be claimed) citeturn18view0

Bridging/onboarding:
- The website suggests users can “deposit from any EVM-compatible wallet” and the protocol bridges the rest. citeturn18view0
- The app UI includes an option labeled “Bridge via relay.link” (suggesting an integrated bridging route). citeturn2view6

2.2 “Shares + PPS” accounting model
- Instead of constantly increasing your share count, Altura frames growth via “Price Per Share (PPS)” increasing. citeturn18view0turn19search2
- Docs emphasize PPS should reflect “real, realized” performance and be visible, timestamped, and signed by authorized reporters. citeturn19search2

2.3 Withdrawal flow (queue + claim)
Altura describes a withdrawal queue mechanism:
- Withdrawals are requested on-chain and processed through an on-chain queue/epochs to manage liquidity. citeturn18view0turn19search2
- The website also mentions “a 6-hour waiting period after deposit before withdrawals can be claimed.” citeturn18view0

Fee/wait nuance (possible doc/UX mismatch):
- Some docs/UX text references “Instant Withdrawals” vs epoch withdrawals (e.g., 0.01% instant withdrawal fee vs 0% epoch fee) on the app’s “Vault” screen. citeturn2view6
- Meanwhile, the FAQ section on the site says Altura “may charge performance and operational fees” and that it’s visible on-chain; exact parameters may change. citeturn18view1
Because fee/wait parameters can change rapidly, treat the UI/on-chain config as source of truth at the time of use.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3) Strategies & yield sources (how it claims to make money)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Altura’s marketing and docs present diversified, (largely) market-neutral or hedged sources of yield.

3.1 Website “Architecture / Institutional-Grade Yield Sources”
The website lists three sources:
- Arbitrage & funding / trading: “market inefficiency capture through hedged perp/spot positions.”
- Real-World Asset (RWA): “RWA trading strategy focused on gold.”
- Structured liquidity provision: “fee generation from Hyperliquid market-making and GMX-style pools.” citeturn18view0

3.2 Docs “Sustainable yield comes from…”
Docs enumerate “organic” sources such as market inefficiencies, funding payments, protocol-level staking rewards, trading fees, and “RWA Markets.” citeturn23view2

3.3 Docs “Strategies” page: off-chain RWA gold trading (important detail)
The strategies page (as indexed in early Jan 2026) specifically describes “Pillar 2” as RWA gold trading via a licensed third-party manager and suggests this is off-chain and historically stable/low volatility. citeturn3view1

NOTE ON INCONSISTENCIES:
- Some pages emphasize staking/restaking as a yield source; the “Strategies” page (in the captured version) emphasizes RWA gold trading as a pillar.
This may be normal evolution of messaging or a partial update across pages; verify the latest docs sections before publishing conclusions. citeturn23view2turn18view1turn3view1

3.4 “Hybrid execution” and off-chain components
Altura explicitly allows for off-chain components (e.g., centralized/perpetual venues, RWA cashflows), but claims all cashflows and PnL movements are “mirrored/settled/accounted for on-chain” over the lifecycle of positions. citeturn19search2turn23view2

Takeaway:
- The protocol’s key promise is that even when execution is hybrid, accounting and value updates should be verifiable on-chain (PPS, balances, flows).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4) Security model, risk controls, and audits
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
4.1 Layered security (high-level)
The website claims:
- Oracle safety
- Vault protections (audits, access controls, safeguards)
- Role restrictions + timelocks
- Withdrawal safeguards citeturn18view0

4.2 Docs: “Safety & Protections” (more concrete controls)
Altura lists smart contract hardening items such as:
- corrected share accounting (rounding/precision attacks)
- slippage/value protection enforcing PPS-aligned outcomes
- oracle validation improvements (bounds, timestamp thresholds, movement limits)
- enforced paused states for sensitive functions
- permissioned transfers only to pre-approved contracts/keeper EOAs
- strict ERC20 allowance handling patterns citeturn26view0

4.3 On-chain verifiability features
Docs claim users can independently verify:
- AUM, shares, PPS changes, NAV movement
- strategy outputs and contributions (funding capture, arbitrage settlements, staking inflows, LP fee revenue)
- oracle report visibility (timestamped, signed, bounded)
- withdrawal queue status and eligibility conditions citeturn19search2

4.4 Audits (as publicly listed)
Altura’s audit index lists:
- Predeposit Audit — Adevarlabs (Dec 2025)
- Vault Audit — Adevarlabs (Dec 2025)
- Vault Audit — Omniscia (Jan 2026) citeturn23view1turn20search1
Notes:
- The audit index links to GitHub/Omniscia; in this environment some GitHub-linked PDFs could not be fetched reliably, so this report only confirms the audit listings, not their findings.

4.5 Risks (what they acknowledge)
The website explicitly calls out:
- smart contract risk
- oracle risk
- liquidity constraints
- broader market risks citeturn18view1
Docs also include a “Legal & User Responsibility Disclosures” section that frames user responsibility and general risks. citeturn10view0

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5) Token / points / incentives (what users “earn” besides yield)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5.1 Vault shares (AVLT / preAVLT)
- The protocol uses a share token (“AVLT” in docs/app context) representing vault ownership. citeturn23view3turn2view6
- Pre-deposit program: users deposit USDT on HyperEVM during pre-deposit and receive “preAVLT” that can be claimed 1:1 for AVLT later. citeturn23view3

5.2 Pre-deposit “Nest Boxes” and points
Docs describe a points gamification layer:
- Depositors receive “Nest Boxes” based on deposit tiers (e.g., $199 → 1 box; $4,999 → 40 boxes).
- Each box yields 1,000 to 50,000 points (range stated).
- “Waitlist users” earn 1 Nest Box if depositing ≥ 10 USDT in HyperEVM. citeturn23view3

5.3 “Altura Points” (mainnet / ongoing)
Some third-party exchange-news posts mention “Altura Points” as ongoing incentives; however, these are secondary sources and can be inaccurate. Prefer protocol docs/app announcements for definitive rules. citeturn20search3turn20search6

5.4 Governance token?
- Public materials captured here focus on vault shares and points; they do not clearly document a separate governance token on the official docs pages captured.
- Treat any “token sale / ALU tokenomics” pages you find online as likely referring to a different Altura project unless the source explicitly ties to altura.trade and HyperEVM/Hyperliquid. citeturn20search21turn22search16

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
6) Business/market context (funding, positioning, ecosystem)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
6.1 Positioning
Altura’s narrative is “sustainable yield” vs “inflationary emission APYs” and “opaque black-box strategies,” with an emphasis on verifiability, hedging, and non-directional/market-neutral approaches. citeturn23view2turn18view1

6.2 Funding (public, but not from Altura docs)
Several public aggregators and reposts report a ~$4M seed round led by Ascension with Moonfare and InnoFinCon participating (reported around Dec 1, 2025). These are not first-party announcements in the captured Altura docs, so treat as context—not core protocol fact.
- CryptoRank fundraising page summary (raised $4M). citeturn22search13
- CypherHunter fundraising entry (Dec 1, 2025; $4M). citeturn22search11
- Multiple news reposts cite Decrypt; direct access to Decrypt was blocked in this environment. citeturn22search10turn22search1

6.3 Ecosystem: Hyperliquid / HyperEVM
Altura states it is deployed on Hyperliquid’s HyperEVM and supports EVM-compatible wallets, with USDT0 as the deposit asset (for now). citeturn18view1turn18view0

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7) Due diligence checklist (what to verify before trusting/using it)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
If you’re writing research or considering usage, verify these items directly from on-chain data and the latest docs/app parameters:

A) Contracts & addresses
- Confirm vault/share token/oracle contract addresses from the docs “Public Contract Addresses” section and compare with on-chain explorers. citeturn19search2

B) Oracle mechanics & movement limits
- Confirm the bounds/timestamp rules for PPS reporting and the authorized reporter addresses. citeturn19search2turn26view0

C) Withdrawal mechanics + fees
- Confirm whether withdrawals are instant vs epoch-based; confirm any explicit fees (instant withdrawal fee, performance/ops fees) from the app UI and/or on-chain contract config. citeturn2view6turn18view1

D) Strategy allocation & “hybrid execution”
- Determine what portion is executed on-chain vs off-chain; confirm how off-chain cashflows are reconciled on-chain, and what transparency you can actually observe. citeturn19search2turn23view2turn3view1

E) Audit reports
- Read the actual PDF reports and verify whether findings were fixed; confirm commit hashes and deployed contract versions match the audited scope. citeturn23view1

F) Points programs
- Confirm whether “Nest Points / Altura Points” affect any token distribution, fee rebates, or future governance; avoid relying on third-party “airdrop speculation.” citeturn23view3turn20search3
