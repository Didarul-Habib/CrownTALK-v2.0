XO MARKET (xo.market) — Deep-Dive Research (Public Sources)
Generated: 2026-01-11 (Asia/Dhaka)

DISCLAIMER
- This is research based on public information (project website, docs, blog posts, third‑party analyses).
- It is NOT financial advice. Always verify details directly with official sources before taking action.
- “XO Market”, “XO”, “xodotmarket”, and various “XO”-named tokens on explorers/aggregators can be confused with unrelated assets. Treat any token/contract claims as unverified unless explicitly confirmed by XO Market’s official channels.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) PROJECT IDENTITY (WHAT IT IS)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Name(s)
- XO Market (brand); X handle commonly referenced as @xodotmarket (also mirrored by third‑party viewers).

One‑line description
- A permissionless “conviction market” platform: users create and trade markets about real‑world outcomes; creators can earn fees; outcomes resolve using a hybrid AI + human dispute layer (MODRA). (XO website + Terms + Blockworks + project blog)

Core promise
- “Trade your convictions” and let markets price beliefs in real time (social + trading feed). (xo.market)

Status
- Mainnet Beta launched Nov 10, 2025 (per XO blog). Alpha was testnet; Beta uses real USDC settlement. (XO blog; third‑party walkthrough)

High-level differentiation (what they claim is different)
- Open market creation (permissionless listings, with guardrails).
- Adaptive liquidity via LS‑LMSR (designed to keep long‑tail markets tradable).
- A bespoke resolution system (MODRA) intended to reduce oracle capture.
- Social/feed UX + gamified reputation/points.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) THE PROBLEM THEY’RE SOLVING
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Traditional prediction markets tend to run into:
A) Market-listing gatekeepers
- Many large platforms restrict what markets can list, limiting long-tail/community markets.
B) Liquidity fragmentation
- Long-tail markets often become thin/illiquid; multi-outcome “bundles of binaries” fragment liquidity.
C) Resolver / oracle capture risks
- Token-vote dispute systems can be dominated by large holders; contentious resolutions degrade trust.
D) UX barriers
- “Crypto-native” tooling and complex flows limit mainstream adoption.

XO’s stated approach is to make “any conviction tradable” by pairing permissionless creation + adaptive liquidity + “AI-first” resolution, wrapped in a social feed UX. (Blockworks; cyber•Fund)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) PRODUCT OVERVIEW (HOW IT WORKS)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3.1 The “Conviction Market” object
A typical market includes:
- Question / statement (must be objectively resolvable)
- Outcome set:
  - Binary (Yes/No), and now Multi-outcome (Nov 2025 update)
- Expiry/trading close + resolution criteria
- Collateral token (USDC in mainnet beta; more planned)
- Creator fee tier (0%–1% depending on requirements)
- Liquidity parameters (seeded initially; curve adapts as volume grows)

3.2 User journeys
A) Join / onboarding
- Login via email/social auth or connect wallet; XO uses Privy for embedded wallet + social login flows. (Terms; Privacy Policy; third‑party walkthrough)
- Beta access can require an invite/referral code (described in XO blog + third‑party walkthrough).

B) Deposit / bridge
- In Beta, users bridge in USDC to trade; blog describes choosing a chain to bridge from.
- A third‑party walkthrough states USDC on Base, Ethereum, and BNB Chain are supported in the deposit flow (verify in-app). (XO blog; blocmates)

C) Trade / positions
- Users buy/sell outcome tokens; pricing comes from LS‑LMSR AMM curve.
- Beta phase started “fee-free” at the protocol level (creator fees still apply) per the Nov 10, 2025 blog post. (XO blog)

D) Create markets (permissionless, but with requirements)
- XO blog: Mainnet Beta creation requires seeding at least 500 USDC; 500 USDC unlocks up to 0.5% creator fee; 1,000+ unlocks 1% creator fee. (XO blog)
- Third‑party: open market creation also ties to a “Catalyst badge” earned via Conviction Points (CP) (500 CP threshold), with an issuance window (e.g., one market per rolling window) — verify as it can change. (blocmates)

E) Earn / incentives
- Creator fees: creators set a fee tier (0–1%) and earn on trading volume in their markets. (XO blog; multi‑outcome post; blocmates)
- Conviction Points (CP): gamified points; higher CP from trades in Beta; caps per market to balance. (XO blog; blocmates)
- Referrals: verified users get referral codes; earn CP based on invitees’ activity; revenue sharing “coming soon.” (XO blog)
- Peck-ins: daily check-in mechanic that carries over from Alpha → Beta. (XO blog; blocmates)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) KEY MECHANISMS (THE “ENGINE”)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4.1 Liquidity: LS‑LMSR (Liquidity-Sensitive Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule)
What XO says it uses
- XO Terms explicitly state the platform uses LS‑LMSR as its AMM model.
- Blockworks highlights LS‑LMSR as a way to bootstrap liquidity for niche markets.

Why it matters
- Traditional designs often require market makers or deep capital to keep markets liquid.
- LS‑LMSR is intended to adapt liquidity/depth as activity grows, making long-tail markets more usable.

Multi‑outcome implementation (Nov 24, 2025)
- XO introduced true multi‑outcome markets: one shared pool/curve across all outcomes.
- When one outcome’s price moves, all others adjust to keep the total coherent (summing to 100%).
- Benefits claimed: less fragmentation; smaller outcomes stay tradable; easier creator seeding. (XO multi‑outcome post)

4.2 Resolution & disputes: MODRA (Market Outcome & Dispute Resolution Agent)
What it is (as described publicly)
- Terms: “hybrid AI-and-juror dispute resolution system called MODRA.”
- Blockworks: “AI-first” oracle that queries trusted APIs and uses ML; disputes escalate to staked token-holder jury with quadratic voting; minority can be slashed.
- cyber•Fund: MODRA is built to avoid external-oracle manipulation; hybrid approach.

A likely conceptual pipeline (derived from sources)
1) Automatic resolution for “easy” outcomes
   - AI agent fetches from trusted sources/APIs and proposes result.
2) Dispute window / challenge
   - If contested or low-confidence, enters dispute phase.
3) Human juror layer (“High Court” in some descriptions)
   - Jurors selected pseudo-randomly; influence weighted by stake and reputation.
   - Quadratic voting used to reduce whale dominance. (blocmates; Blockworks)
4) Final settlement on-chain
   - Smart contracts distribute payouts based on final resolution.

4.3 MEV / fairness protections (Dec 24, 2025 post)
- XO published “The MEV Problem,” arguing that visible orders in AMMs can be exploited (e.g., sandwiching),
  and that this can be extra harmful in fast-moving “feed-style” markets.
- They frame “Protecting the Feed” as a priority (exact mitigation details may evolve; check latest posts). (XO blog)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5) ARCHITECTURE & INFRASTRUCTURE (WHAT’S KNOWN PUBLICLY)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
There are multiple public descriptions; treat this section as “best-effort” from sources.

5.1 “Sovereign appchain / Celestia DA” narrative
- Blockworks calls XO an “upcoming prediction market built as a sovereign appchain using Celestia for data availability.”
- cyber•Fund also describes XO as built on a sovereign rollup/appchain with Celestia DA. (Blockworks; cyber•Fund)

5.2 “BNB Liquidity Hub” narrative (XO’s GitHub readme)
- XO Market published a “BNB Liquidity Hub Overview” stating:
  - the “liquidity hub lives on BNB Chain”
  - a “hybrid engine for instant trades and on-chain verification”
  - “settlement contracts deployed on BNB Chain”
  - front-end “CrowdFeed” social UI
  - gamification via Conviction Points
(From xo-market/bnb-readme on GitHub)

Reconciling the two
- It’s plausible XO uses a multi-layer architecture (e.g., a settlement/liquidity hub on BNB Chain, with additional components or data availability on Celestia).
- Public sources do not provide a single canonical architecture diagram that can be independently verified here.
- For “source of truth,” verify the latest official technical docs/whitepaper when available.

5.3 Wallet/authentication
- Privacy Policy and Terms state XO uses Privy for social login + embedded (self-custodial) wallet; XO claims it does not store user private keys. (Terms; Privacy Policy)

5.4 Non-custodial claims
- Terms: XO is “non-custodial interface to blockchain-based smart contracts” and does not hold user funds. (Terms)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6) TOKEN, POINTS, AND ECONOMICS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.1 What exists today (confirmed by primary sources)
- USDC settlement in mainnet beta (trades/payouts/leaderboard activity settle in USDC). (XO blog)
- Creator fees on markets (0–1%), with creation seed tiers. (XO blog; multi‑outcome post)
- CP (Conviction Points) as gamified incentive; higher CP during Beta; caps; referrals; daily check-ins (“peck-ins”). (XO blog; blocmates)

6.2 XO token (future / partially referenced)
- Blockworks describes “staked XO token holders” in the dispute layer and slashing for minority voters.
- Third‑party viewers show campaigns implying “future XO Market token supply” rewards.
- Some third‑party sites speculate about token sales/airdrops; treat as unconfirmed unless XO publishes official tokenomics docs.

6.3 Beware “lookalike tokens”
- There are tokens named similarly (“xodotmarket”, “XO Market”, etc.) on various chains and aggregators.
- Unless XO’s official website/docs explicitly publish a contract address and chain, assume these may be unrelated.

6.4 Revenue model (publicly described)
- Creator fees on trades.
- Potential future “revenue sharing” linked to referrals (per XO blog).
- Protocol fees were stated as “none” at Beta phase start (Nov 2025); may change later. (XO blog)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7) TEAM, ORIGIN, BACKERS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7.1 Origin story
- XO blog: “grew from an idea at a hackathon” into a platform; Blockworks notes Celestia Mammothon hackathon context. (XO blog; Blockworks)

7.2 Fundraising
- Blockworks (Jul 1, 2025): XO Market raised a $500K pre-seed round led by cyber•Fund and Delphi Ventures. (Blockworks)
- XO website “Our backers” section also references Delphi Ventures and cyber•Fund (verify page). (xo.market)

7.3 Team (publicly available)
- XO’s own site does not prominently list team bios on the main landing page (at least in the fetched view).
- Some third‑party sites list names (often without primary sourcing). Treat as unverified unless confirmed by XO.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8) COMMUNITY, ACCESS, AND GROWTH LOOPS
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Community touchpoints
- Website links to Blog, Docs, and X; GitHub readme lists Discord and founders@xo.market email. (xo.market; GitHub readme)

Access mechanics
- Invite / referral codes (5 per verified user per XO blog).
- Waitlist option when no code is available. (XO blog)

Gamification loops
- CP (Conviction Points)
- Badges (e.g., “Catalyst badge” in third‑party walkthrough; verify inside app)
- Daily check-ins (“peck-ins”)
- Leaderboards and potentially seasonal campaigns

Integrations (reported by third parties)
- Bitget Wallet integration + access code campaign reported by an outposts post (verify current availability). (Outposts)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
9) LEGAL, COMPLIANCE, AND USER SAFETY (FROM XO DOCS)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Terms highlights
- Age: 18+ required. (Terms)
- Restricted regions list includes (explicitly mentioned): US, UK, France, Singapore, Ontario (Canada), plus sanctioned jurisdictions; also prohibits bypassing via VPN/proxy. (Terms)
- Prohibited markets: illegal activity, violence/personal harm, privacy violations, defamatory/harassing content, etc. (Terms)
- Non-custodial: XO says it does not custody user funds and cannot recover wallets. (Terms)
- Outcome finality: users agree MODRA outcomes are final/binding; limited recourse. (Terms)

Privacy highlights (Last updated June 5, 2025)
- “Privacy-preserving” with minimal personal data collection.
- Privy handles authentication; XO may receive limited account identifiers and possibly email.
- Optional X (Twitter) verification to link profile; warns this makes a public link between X identity and XO activity. (Privacy Policy)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
10) COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE (WHERE IT SITS)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Direct comparables
- Polymarket / Kalshi: curated listings, heavy attention, large-volume flagship markets.
- UMA-based dispute systems (oracle capture debates referenced by Blockworks).

XO’s positioning (publicly described)
- “pump.fun of prediction markets” (Blockworks framing): permissionless market creation + creator economy.
- Focus on long-tail, social/discoverability feed (“CrowdFeed”), and resolution trust. (XO site; GitHub readme; Blockworks)

Potential differentiation risks
- Permissionless creation raises moderation/compliance burdens.
- Hybrid AI resolution must maintain credibility and transparency to avoid “black box” concerns.
- Liquidity model performance under adversarial conditions is key.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
11) RISKS & OPEN QUESTIONS (DUE DILIGENCE CHECKLIST)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Technical
- Confirm what chain(s) the settlement contracts actually live on (BNB hub vs Celestia-based components).
- Verify contract audits, bug bounty, and security posture (not found clearly in fetched sources).
- Understand bridging/settlement custody assumptions (who controls bridge, how USDC is held/represented).

Market integrity
- How does XO prevent low-quality, unresolvable, or manipulative markets at scale?
- What’s the exact dispute procedure, timing, and evidence standard for MODRA?
- How transparent are AI decisions and what are the override rules?

Economics
- What are the final fee schedules once protocol fees turn on?
- Token issuance/utility (if any) and governance assumptions.
- Sustainability of incentives (CP, referrals, campaigns).

Regulatory & compliance
- Jurisdictional restrictions are broad; users must confirm local legality.
- Prediction markets are heavily regulated in many jurisdictions.
