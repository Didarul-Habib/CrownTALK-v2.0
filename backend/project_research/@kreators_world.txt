Kreators World (kreators.world) — Deep Dive (All Angles)
Generated: 2026-01-10

NOTE ON SOURCE ACCESS
- The main website (kreators.world) blocks some automated fetches (HTTP 403) in this environment, so I relied on: (a) search-engine cached extracts of key pages, (b) the project’s Linktree, (c) the project’s X profile via a public mirror (Muskviewer), (d) Telegram preview pages, and (e) other public references. Where something couldn’t be directly verified from primary pages, I clearly mark it as “unconfirmed / needs verification.”

======================================================================
1) What the project is (plain-English)
======================================================================
Kreators World is a Web3-oriented “KOL / creator marketing” platform that connects crypto projects (brands) with vetted creators (KOLs) to run social campaigns—primarily around X/Twitter. It positions itself as:
- A marketplace and workflow tool for brands to launch influencer campaigns.
- A creator monetization layer where creators complete campaign tasks and earn rewards.
- An AI/ML layer that helps brands select KOLs and plan campaigns and helps the platform score/forecast campaign performance.

A distinguishing angle in the project’s public messaging:
- Payments are described as “dripping USDC on Base directly into your wallet” (USDC payouts on Base L2), implying payouts happen on-chain.

======================================================================
2) Who it’s for
======================================================================
For Web3 brands / projects
- Run campaigns to increase visibility, impressions, and engagement.
- Source KOLs quickly and (per positioning) reduce middlemen.

For creators / KOLs
- Join as a “Kreator.”
- Participate in verified campaigns and earn rewards (described as USDC on Base, and also “tokens through social engagement” in site copy).

======================================================================
3) Product surface (what users see)
======================================================================
Public site navigation (as shown in cached extracts) includes:
- Campaigns
- K-rank
- LB (leaderboard)
- Discover KOLs
- For Creators
- For Brands
- Dashboard
- Technology / ML
- How It Works
- Company / About
- Privacy / Terms

3.1 Campaigns
- The “Campaigns” page is intended to show active blockchain marketing campaigns and let creators earn via social engagement.
- Cached extracts show the page sometimes returns an error loading campaigns (suggesting the frontend depends on an API response).

3.2 K-rank + Leaderboard (LB)
- These appear to be ranking/leaderboard surfaces, likely used to measure creator performance and/or campaign contribution. (Details not fully visible from accessible sources—needs direct in-app inspection.)

3.3 Discover KOLs
- Suggests a searchable creator directory for brands to find and shortlist creators.

3.4 Dashboard (auth-gated)
- The dashboard requires sign-in and likely contains:
  - Campaign creation flows (for brands)
  - Campaign participation/task submission (for creators)
  - Wallet/payout configuration
  - Analytics / performance reporting

======================================================================
4) “AI Campaign Agents” (automation angle)
======================================================================
The homepage cached extract references “AI Campaign Agents” and pitches:
- Let AI create a campaign strategy,
- Source top KOLs,
- Monitor performance automatically.

This implies a roadmap / current feature that resembles:
- Automated campaign brief generation
- Automated creator shortlisting and outreach
- Automated monitoring and reporting

======================================================================
5) ML / Scoring & Selection (the “tech” claim)
======================================================================
A cached extract from the Technology/ML section claims:
- “Our proprietary ensemble of 5 ML models”
- Analyzing “35+ factors including sentiment, engagement patterns, content quality, and historical performance”
- Producing “confidence-scored predictions” with “95%+ accuracy”

Important due diligence note:
- The “95%+ accuracy” claim is marketing unless there is a published methodology (test sets, evaluation window, definition of accuracy, etc.). Ask the team for:
  - What is being predicted (engagement? conversions? ROI?)
  - How they label outcomes
  - How accuracy is measured (AUC, MAPE, etc.)

======================================================================
6) Reward / payout system (creator economics)
======================================================================
6.1 Fair Reward System (site claim)
The “How it works” page (cached extract) frames rewards as:
- Transparent
- Fair
- Performance-based
- “Every kreator deserves to know exactly how their earnings are calculated.”

6.2 USDC on Base (X bio claim)
The project’s X profile (via public mirror) states:
- They “drip USDC on Base, directly into your wallet.”

So the platform appears to align with:
- On-chain payouts in USDC on Base (L2), likely to reduce friction and make payouts fast/trackable.

6.3 Tokens vs USDC (possible ambiguity)
Some site copy also says “Earn tokens through social media engagement.”
This could mean:
- Some campaigns pay in project tokens, while the platform itself pays USDC for certain tasks.
- Or “tokens” is generic marketing language for rewards.

Recommendation:
- Validate payout types by checking the dashboard payout screen, recent campaign terms, and on-chain payout transactions (Base explorer links).

======================================================================
7) Traction / metrics (from public social)
======================================================================
In a New Year post (via X mirror), the account claims that since launching campaigns in October:
- Worked with 15 clients
- Distributed over $25,000 to creators
- Onboarded 3,000 monthly active users
- Generated 11.1M+ impressions

Treat these as self-reported metrics until independently verified (e.g., campaign list + payout proofs + analytics screenshots).

======================================================================
8) Community / distribution channels
======================================================================
- Linktree: positions Kreators as an “AI powered KOL campaign creation tool” connecting Web3 brands to KOLs.
- Telegram: public preview indicates an official group described as “a space dedicated to creators to help drive growth across X campaigns.”
- YouTube: a short promo video claims “Connect to over 1500 KOLs for free” (needs verification in-product).

======================================================================
9) Competitive landscape (how it compares)
======================================================================
Category: Web3 influencer/KOL campaign platforms
Typical competitors include:
- KOL marketplaces / agencies (often Web2 style with manual matching)
- Web3 campaign platforms (task boards, “earn for posts” systems)
- Social incentive products on Base/Solana that pay creators

Likely differentiation levers for Kreators:
- AI-based creator selection and campaign automation (“AI Campaign Agents”)
- On-chain USDC payouts on Base
- Ranking/leaderboard layers (K-rank/LB) to measure performance

======================================================================
10) Risks & due diligence checklist (important)
======================================================================
A) Transparency & accuracy of ML claims
- Ask for evaluation methodology behind “95%+ accuracy” and what KPI it predicts.

B) Payout proofs and fraud prevention
- How does Kreators verify that a creator actually performed tasks (posts, engagement quality, link clicks)?
- Anti-sybil / anti-bot mechanisms: account age, follower integrity scoring, content originality checks, etc.

C) Legal / compliance
- Terms/Privacy exist on the site but were not directly accessible here due to anti-bot measures.
- If you plan to onboard brands, confirm:
  - Payment terms, dispute policy, refund rules
  - Data usage policy (creator data / social graph)
  - Jurisdiction, entity name, and contact methods

D) “Token” confusion
There is a Solana token labeled “Kreators” on Solscan with a 1B supply and “pump.fun” tag. This may be unrelated to the Kreators World platform.
Do NOT assume it is the platform’s token unless the team explicitly confirms the mint address.

======================================================================
11) How to evaluate quickly (practical steps)
======================================================================
For brands
1) Try to create a campaign:
   - Is there a campaign brief builder?
   - Can you define deliverables, timeline, payout, and tracking?
2) Check creator discovery:
   - Can you filter by niche, engagement, geography, and quality metrics?
3) Check reporting:
   - Are impressions/engagement tracked automatically?
   - Are there proofs (links to posts, snapshots, verifications)?
4) Confirm payouts:
   - USDC on Base? Any escrow? Any platform fees?

For creators
1) Sign up and connect your X account.
2) Look at campaign terms and rules.
3) Track how rewards are computed (performance-based formula).
4) Verify payouts via your wallet and on Base explorer links.
