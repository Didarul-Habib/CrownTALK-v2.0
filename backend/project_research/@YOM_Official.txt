YOM (yom.net) — Deep-Dive Research Report
Generated: 2026-01-10 (Asia/Dhaka)

NOTE ON SOURCES & DATES
- This report is built from YOM’s official website and documentation (GitBook), plus reputable third‑party sources (e.g., TrustSwap, Outlier Ventures).
- Some time-sensitive items (like TGE/IDO dates) appear inconsistent across sources. Where relevant, the report cites both the “as announced” and “later updated” statements and flags uncertainty.

===============================================================================
1) Executive Summary (What YOM is)
===============================================================================
YOM positions itself as a decentralized cloud gaming infrastructure (a DePIN) that turns distributed GPU capacity (e.g., community gaming PCs and other providers) into a network that can stream high-end games and 3D experiences to any device via the browser (pixel streaming / “instant play”). 

Core thesis:
- Cloud gaming is expensive and latency-sensitive when done via centralized datacenters.
- YOM tries to reduce cost and improve reach by orchestrating a distributed edge network of GPUs closer to players, and by making distribution “link/embed-based” (like embedding a video).

High-level value props (per YOM):
- “Instant Play” (1-click, no installs) across channels (web embeds, Telegram/Discord, etc.).
- “Server-less” distribution: the network allocates GPUs/nodes dynamically, so publishers don’t pre-reserve instances.
- Lower cost vs centralized streaming, with session-based pricing.
- A tokenized incentives layer to reward operators based on real usage, plus deflationary mechanics.

Primary sources:
- YOM product site: https://yom.net/product
- YOM Docs (overview / solution / tokenomics): https://docs.yom.net/

===============================================================================
2) The Problem YOM Claims to Solve
===============================================================================
2.1 Centralized cloud gaming constraints
- Centralized cloud gaming requires large capital expenditure and high operational costs.
- Latency is a major constraint; far-away datacenters can create high input lag and poor experience.

YOM’s framing (docs + marketing):
- Cloud gaming should feel “console-like” (low latency, high FPS).
- Distribution should be as easy as sharing a link (no downloads).
- Studios should avoid “platform tolls” and distribution gatekeepers.

- https://docs.yom.net/solution/how-it-works

===============================================================================
3) YOM’s Product Offering (Publisher / Studio Side)
===============================================================================
YOM describes itself as a cloud gaming distribution platform for publishers that makes any game “instant-play” through streaming. 

3.1 “Publish” / deploy flow
The docs include a “Quick Start” that describes a basic deployment lifecycle:
- Compile a game build for Linux
- Publish via YOM’s app (app.yom.net), deploy on network
- Integrate streams/embeds and handle authentication/events as needed
Source:
- Quick Start: https://docs.yom.net/build/quick-start

3.2 Distribution formats & channels
From YOM’s product page, they emphasize embedding games anywhere and running in multiple channels (Telegram/Discord/Facebook, etc.), with responsive HUDs and easy integration.
Source:
- https://yom.net/product

3.3 Pricing model (what studios pay)
YOM describes session-based pricing (often referenced as ~$0.05 per session, with subscriptions/tiers for analytics/support). The docs FAQ clarifies a model like:
- $0.05 per session (based on ~10 minutes average session)
- $89/month base fee for analytics/dashboard access
Source:
- FAQ: https://docs.yom.net/about/faq
- Product page tiers: https://yom.net/product

3.4 “Keep 100% revenue / zero platform fees”
YOM’s messaging claims developers keep 100% of revenue by bypassing platform fees/tolls, and can self-publish.
Source:
- https://yom.net/product
(Interpretation: this is a distribution + streaming layer; the “100% revenue” claim depends on your monetization stack and where you distribute.)

===============================================================================
4) YOM’s DePIN / Network Architecture (Operator Side)
===============================================================================
4.1 What is a “node” in YOM?
YOM nodes are machines that can run (host) a single concurrent game session for a player; the game is rendered on the node and streamed to the player in real time.
Source:
- Operators: https://docs.yom.net/solution/operators

4.2 HyperOrch scheduler (orchestration layer)
YOM describes HyperOrch as its orchestration engine that:
- Collects a “capability vector” from nodes (GPU/CPU/memory/bandwidth/thermal headroom, etc.)
- Characterizes game workloads by resource footprint
- Matches players to nodes in real time based on latency + suitability + load
- Learns from session outcomes to improve placement decisions
Source:
- Network: https://docs.yom.net/solution/network

4.3 NodeOS / isolation & ops automation (as described)
In the network section, YOM describes an operating layer that:
- Auto-detects hardware and installs signed GPU drivers
- Performs registration, bandwidth/latency checks, publishes capability vector to the discovery ledger
- Provides an isolated sandbox for execution (read-only mount of images; GPU pass-through)
Source:
- Network: https://docs.yom.net/solution/network

4.4 Rewards model (high-level mechanics)
YOM emphasizes “real work” and usage-driven rewards vs emissions-only models.
Key details:
- Studios/publishers pay for sessions (priced in USD)
- A distribution key allocates rewards among nodes, network operations, and burns
- A burn component makes supply deflationary (see tokenomics section)

Sources:
- Operators: https://docs.yom.net/solution/operators
- Payout: https://docs.yom.net/solution/payout
- Blockchain: https://docs.yom.net/solution/blockchain

4.5 Workload and regional differentiation
YOM describes reward multipliers based on:
- Workload difficulty (harder games/4K/60FPS etc. consume more resources)
- Regional differentiation via “regional tokens” (e.g., $yEU, $yCHN) in burn/mint relationship with $YOM, and liquidity pools that support region-specific pricing
Sources:
- Payout: https://docs.yom.net/solution/payout

===============================================================================
5) “NANO” Hardware + Node Licenses + Delegation
===============================================================================
5.1 YOM NANO concept (plug-and-play operator product)
YOM markets “NANO” as a plug-and-play node runner concept to turn a gaming PC into a revenue-generating node setup (their marketing claims potential monthly earning ranges; treat as illustrative, not guaranteed).
Sources:
- YOM NANO landing: https://yom.net/nano
- Docs (earn section): https://docs.yom.net/earn

5.2 Node Licenses (capacity scaling)
- YOM describes “Node License” NFTs as the right to stream more nodes from a host machine or delegate them to others.
- Docs state a maximum of 8 licenses per PC (depending on bandwidth and rig performance), and that every NANO starts with 1 free embedded license.
Source:
- Node Licenses: https://docs.yom.net/earn/node-licenses
- Operators: https://docs.yom.net/solution/operators

5.3 NaaS Delegation (Node-as-a-Service)
For users who don’t want to run hardware themselves, YOM docs describe delegating a Node License to NaaS providers for a monthly fee; rewards depend on provider performance (not risk-free).
Source:
- NaaS Delegation: https://docs.yom.net/earn/naas-delegation

5.4 Maximizing payout (behavioral + technical levers)
YOM suggests operators can optimize earnings by:
- Increasing node count (more licenses)
- Increasing node utilization by boosting “XP/reputation” and uptime reliability
- Being available during high demand periods
Source:
- Maximizing Payout: https://docs.yom.net/earn/maximizing-payout

===============================================================================
6) Token, Chain, and Economic Design
===============================================================================
6.1 Chain approach (Avalanche + YOM L1)
YOM’s docs describe:
- Built on Avalanche, with plans/positioning around a custom Avalanche-based L1 engineered for edge gaming.
Source:
- Blockchain: https://docs.yom.net/solution/blockchain

6.2 Deflationary mechanics and burns
YOM describes:
- No new tokens can be minted (strict cap)
- When someone plays/uses the network, a portion is burned in $YOM and a regional token (e.g., 2.5% + 2.5% for a 5% total burn, per docs)
Sources:
- Blockchain: https://docs.yom.net/solution/blockchain
- Payout: https://docs.yom.net/solution/payout

6.3 Staking vs LP/farming (per docs)
YOM docs state that because payouts are for compute provided, users cannot “stake” tokens to earn rewards in the same way; instead, holders can provide liquidity in pools and farm rewards.
Source:
- Blockchain: https://docs.yom.net/solution/blockchain

6.4 Token allocation snapshot (from YOM docs)
YOM’s docs list:
- Total tokens: 250,000,000
- Home chain: Avalanche (C-Chain / YOM L1)
- Trading chains via LayerZero: Base, BSC, peaq, Solana, Somnia, Avalanche C-Chain
- TGE price: 0.1000
- Initial market cap (excl locked liquidity): $679,645
Allocation categories include (percentages as in docs):
- Ecosystem: 22.5%
- OPEX: 37.5%
- Community: 27.5%
- Public Round: 2%
- Strategic Round: 5%
- Liquidity pool: 6%
Source:
- Token Allocation: https://docs.yom.net/about/token-allocation

6.5 Token launch / TGE timing — conflicting signals
There are conflicting statements across sources:
- YOM’s Telegram announcement (Oct 29, 2025) says “TGE set for Dec 9, 2025 on Avalanche”.
  Source: https://t.me/s/YOM_announcements (post referenced in web snapshot)
- TrustSwap blog (Nov 20, 2025) says the team chose to postpone the IDO and TGE into Q1 2026, even though the same page also lists prior dates.
  Source: https://trustswap.com/blog/yom-on-trustswap-launchpad/

Practical guidance:
- Treat TGE/IDO dates as “subject to change”.
- Verify on official channels (YOM announcements + launchpad updates).

10) Practical Due-Diligence Checklist (Risks, Verification Steps)
===============================================================================
If you’re evaluating YOM (as an operator, studio, or investor), consider verifying:

A) Product reality & traction
- Can you access a live demo or published games running on YOM today?
- Check app.yom.net deployment flow and whether “instant play” experiences meet the latency/FPS claims.
- Ask for case studies beyond marketing highlights.

B) Economics
- Confirm actual session demand and utilization rates for operators (earnings depend on demand).
- Understand how regional tokens work, where liquidity sits, and what volatility looks like.

C) Token / launch
- Confirm current contract addresses, supported chains, and official exchange listings ONLY via official channels.
- Resolve TGE/IDO schedule by checking the latest official announcements.

D) Security / isolation
- Review how game images are sandboxed, how anti-cheat / abuse prevention works (if applicable), and how operator machines are protected.

E) Legal and compliance
- Read token disclaimer, terms and privacy policies, and confirm your jurisdictional constraints.
