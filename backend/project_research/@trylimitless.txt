LIMITLESS EXCHANGE (Limitless.Exchange / TryLimitless) — Deep Dive (Every Angle)

Last updated: 2026-01-11
Scope: Public-web research only (no private/internal data)

================================================================================
1) Executive snapshot
================================================================================
Limitless Exchange is a Base-native, on-chain prediction market focused on ultra-short
duration price-outcome contracts (“minute / hourly / daily” style markets). Users trade
binary outcome shares (YES/NO) via an orderbook (CLOB) interface. The project positions
itself as a simpler alternative to mainstream derivatives/perps for retail, emphasizing:
- instant settlement (short cycles)
- no forced liquidations (bounded loss = premium paid)
- no hidden fees (per its marketing/press positioning)

Key product thesis (investor profile): “Bridging the gap between prediction markets and
mainstream derivatives trading,” with markets like “BTC above X in 30/60 minutes,” but
without liquidation risk. (See references.)

================================================================================
2) Quick facts (at a glance)
================================================================================
Name: Limitless Exchange
Builder: Limitless Labs (brand site: https://limitless.network/)
Primary app entry: https://limitless.exchange/pro  (front-end is heavily JS-rendered)
Chain focus: Base (Ethereum L2)
Market model: Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) for YES/NO shares
Token: LMTS (Limitless Official Token) on Base
- Contract: 0x9EadbE35F3Ee3bF3e28180070C429298a1b02F93
- Decimals: 18
- Max total supply shown on BaseScan: 1,000,000,000 LMTS

================================================================================
3) What the product is (plain-English)
================================================================================
A) “Prediction market” framing
In a prediction market, you buy shares that pay $1 if the stated condition is true at
resolution (and $0 if false). The price of a share often represents the market-implied
probability. For example:
- YES price $0.15 ≈ 15% implied probability
- If YES resolves: each share pays $1
- If NO resolves: each share pays $0

B) “Short-term price markets” framing
Limitless focuses on fast-expiring markets tied to price levels of crypto assets and
major indices. This resembles the payoff intuition of ultra-short-dated options (“0DTE”),
but uses a fully-paid share model instead of margin + liquidation mechanics.

C) “No liquidation risk” (why they can claim that)
In a fully-paid YES/NO share model, you can’t be “liquidated” the way a leveraged perp can,
because you do not maintain an open leveraged debt position. Your maximum loss is what
you paid for the shares. This is why the team and investors highlight “no liquidation
risk.” (Still: smart contract/oracle risks exist—see diligence.)

================================================================================
4) User journey (what someone does in the app)
================================================================================
1) Connect wallet on Base
2) Browse markets (crypto + stocks/indices price conditions; durations like 30/60 minutes)
3) Choose YES or NO and place an order:
   - Market-style execution or limit orders on the orderbook
4) Optionally provide liquidity (resting limit orders / LP incentives)
5) At resolution, winning shares settle to $1, losing shares to $0 (collateral payout)

Some public descriptions mention a common conditional-token mechanic:
- a YES share + NO share (same market) can be redeemed for 1 unit of collateral before
  resolution (often USDC), enabling splitting/merging positions.

================================================================================
5) Market design & trading mechanics
================================================================================
A) CLOB (Central Limit Order Book)
Limitless uses a traditional bid/ask orderbook model for YES/NO shares. Benefits:
- transparent price discovery
- tight spreads when liquidity is strong
- limit orders for market makers

B) Order types (developer docs / SDKs)
Public SDK docs emphasize two core order types:
- FOK (Fill-or-Kill): market-style; executes immediately at best price or cancels
- GTC (Good-’Til-Cancelled): limit order; rests on book until filled/cancelled

C) “Hybrid” architecture (off-chain matching, on-chain settlement)
Limitless’ public GitHub includes a Conditional Tokens Framework (CTF) exchange component
describing:
- atomic swaps between CTF ERC1155 assets and ERC20 collateral
- a hybrid model: an operator performs off-chain matching, while settlement happens
  on-chain and non-custodially

This architecture can improve speed/UX, but introduces operator-related considerations
(e.g., sequencing, censorship, matching fairness), even if custody is not centralized.

================================================================================
6) Technology surface: API + SDKs
================================================================================
A) Trading API (REST + WebSocket) — https://api.limitless.exchange/api-v1
Public API description states support for:
- wallet authentication via message signing
- market data (including venue contract addresses per market)
- order creation + EIP-712 signing
- order submission
- WebSocket streaming (real-time updates)

B) Python SDK (PyPI: limitless-sdk)
Feature set includes:
- async client (aiohttp), EIP-712 auth, markets/orderbooks/historical data
- order management incl. GTC and FOK
- positions + trading history
- websockets for real-time orderbook
- retries and session re-auth; venue/contract caching

C) TypeScript SDK (GitHub: limitless-exchange-ts-sdk)
Public repo positions a TS SDK for interacting with both CLOB and “NegRisk” markets,
offering type-safe access to market data + trading actions.

================================================================================
7) Token: LMTS (Limitless Official Token)
================================================================================
A) On-chain facts (BaseScan)
- Token: “Limitless Official Token (LMTS)”
- Contract: 0x9EadbE35F3Ee3bF3e28180070C429298a1b02F93
- Max total supply: 1,000,000,000 LMTS
- Contract code visible on BaseScan indicates a straightforward ERC20 + ERC20Permit
  contract with fixed TOTALSUPPLY, minted to a list of wallets at deployment.

B) Stated use cases (press coverage)
Coverage and announcements describe token purposes such as:
- liquidity incentives/rewards
- governance and ecosystem alignment
- (sometimes) staking benefits or fee discounts (verify in official docs)

C) Tokenomics gap
BaseScan links to a “Whitepaper” (Notion), but that Notion document was not accessible
in this environment (404). So this report does NOT claim specific allocations/vesting.

================================================================================
8) Incentives: Points program (Season-based)
================================================================================
Limitless has run multi-month “Points Seasons” intended to reward activity (trade, LP,
referrals) and to bootstrap liquidity/engagement ahead of token events.

From Limitless blog snippets:
- Points Season 1: July 1 → Sept 22, 2025
- Points Season 2: Sept 22, 2025 → Jan 26, 2026

Press releases about the points program emphasize:
- trading
- providing liquidity
- referrals (inviting new users)

================================================================================
9) Company, team & governance signals
================================================================================
Builder brand: Limitless Labs
Public coverage identifies:
- CEO: CJ Hetherington
- Founding team referenced in coverage: CJ Hetherington, Roman Mogylnyi, Dmytro Horshkov,
  Rev Miller

Always verify current team roster on official channels (company site + official social).

================================================================================
10) Funding & investors (public disclosures)
================================================================================
A) July 2025 (strategic round press)
- Reports $4M strategic funding
- References earlier $3M pre-seed led by 1confirmation
- Mentions Arthur Hayes as an advisor in that release context
- Mentions rapid early volume (~$250M) and “0DTE-like” short-term markets

B) Oct 2025 (seed round press / coverage)
- Reports a $10M seed led by 1confirmation
- Lists investors including Collider Ventures, F‑Prime Capital, DCG, Coinbase Ventures,
  Node Capital, Arrington Capital, etc.
- Highlights momentum ahead of LMTS token launch

================================================================================
11) Traction (reported) and interpretation
================================================================================
Reported metrics across disclosures/coverage include:
- “Over $250M bet / volume soon after launch” (mid-2025 press)
- “Surpassed ~$500M total trading volume” (late-2025 press/coverage)

Interpretation (inference, not a fact claim):
If these numbers reflect organic demand (vs incentive wash), Limitless has discovered a
high-retention loop: frequent short-duration markets → repeat engagement → liquidity →
better execution → more volume.

================================================================================
12) Security, integrity, and risk (diligence checklist)
================================================================================
A) Smart contract risk (critical)
- Verify deployments, code, upgradeability, admin keys, pausing powers.
- Confirm audits for the contracts actually in use on Base.

B) “Hybrid operator” risk
- Off-chain matching operator can affect fairness (sequencing, cancellations).
- Ask for clarity on order matching rules and anti-manipulation controls.

C) Oracle / resolution risk (most important in prediction markets)
- What oracle or price source resolves markets?
- How are outages, exchange halts, forks, or extreme volatility handled?
- Is there a dispute process? Who controls it?

D) Market manipulation risk
- Short windows increase sensitivity to last-minute spikes and microstructure noise.
- Understand the exact timestamp used for resolution price and how it’s sourced.

E) Regulatory risk
- Prediction markets/event contracts are regulated differently by jurisdiction.
- Expect geo restrictions and compliance measures at the front-end layer.

F) Incentive distortions
- Points programs can encourage wash trading and artificial liquidity.
- Token launch can introduce volatility + misalignment if incentives shift suddenly.

================================================================================
13) Competitive landscape (context)
================================================================================
Closest analogs:
- Polymarket (CLOB/CTF style prediction markets)
- Regulated event contract venues (e.g., Kalshi)
- Other on-chain prediction markets (Omen, etc.)

Limitless differentiators (as publicly positioned):
- ultra-short-term price markets (minutes/hours)
- “no liquidation risk” framing
- Base-native UX and low fees
- mobile-first approach

================================================================================
14) Gaps / what wasn’t verifiable here
================================================================================
Due to heavy JS rendering or inaccessible docs:
- full official whitepaper/tokenomics
- exact fee schedule, maker/taker model
- detailed oracle/resolution process & governance for disputes
- precise current product constraints/geo restrictions

If you want, I can draft a “due diligence questionnaire” tailored to these gaps.
